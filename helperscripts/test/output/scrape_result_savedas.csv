Societal and Ethical Implications of Computing
Alexander Maggiacomo","We live in a strange world, with strange rules and strange lifestyles. Never before, in the recorded history of Earth, has such a time ever occurred. The drive of humanity to innovate has broken a new threshold, and we shall all suffer in its irreversible consequences, for good or ill. What do we owe for this change? The Computer. This technological marvel has catapulted us farther than its inventors ever could have imagined. Humanity is now dependent on this technology, and it is of the utmost importance that all people working in a relevant field should have at least a basic understanding of ethics in computing.
This paper will be doing an analysis of the problem presented in “Baase, Sara, and Timothy Henry. A Gift of Fire: Social, Legal, and Ethical Issues for Computing Technology. Pearson, 2018, p.p. 37-38.” As quoted from the text,
You are a manager at a software company about to begin a large software project. You will need to hire dozens of programmers. Using the Internet for communication and software delivery, you can hire programmers in another country at a lower salary than programmers in your country. Should you do this?
This is an excellent real-world ethical issue. Depending on what lens you use to analyze it, you receive many different answers – A common occurrence whenever ethical questions are posed. According to the same text mentioned above, where they consider the problem as hiring U.S. or Indian programmers, “Shall we weigh the utilities of the programmers according to the number of dollars they will receive? That favors hiring the U.S. programmers. Or should we weigh utility by comparing the pay to the average salary in each country or by comparing the number of other job opportunities available? Those measures might favor hiring the Indians. We see that a calculation of net utility for the programmers depends on how one evaluates the utility of the job for each group of programmers.” This quote clearly displays the issue of hiring based on a perceived “utility”, as the utility can also vary, depending on the analytical approach you take.
This paper’s analysis will specifically be using the ideals of John Rawls to determine whether or not it is ethical to hire Indian programmers,”. According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ""John Rawls (b. 1921, d. 2002) was an American political philosopher in the liberal tradition. His theory of justice as fairness describes a society of free citizens holding equal basic rights and cooperating within an egalitarian economic system.” Further, he describes a tool known as the “Veil of Ignorance.” According to “Baase, Sara, and Timothy Henry. A Gift of Fire: Social, Legal, and Ethical Issues for ComputingTechnology. Pearson, 2018, p.p. 37-38,” when we use this tool, “We imagine that each person behind the veil of ignorance does not know his or her gender, age, race, talents, wealth, and so on in the real world. Behind the veil of ignorance, we choose policies that would be fair for all, protecting the most vulnerable and least-advantaged members of society.”
In this analysis, we shall focus mainly on his “justice as fairness” theory. In this theory, he argues that, “… an individual should not only have the right to opportunities, but should have an effective equal chance as another of similar natural ability.” If this was used to analyze the provided problem, it would seem that, Indian or U.S., each programmer should have an effective and equal change to get the job. Going off of this then, would mean that it would be unethical to hire somebody solely based upon their salary. If this is the case, then I would argue that it is indeed unethical to hire Indian programmers, IF the sole reason for doing so is that they demand a significantly lower salary. Unfortunately, it seems that the problem does not stop there. For, that theory would also state that Indian programmers should be given an equal chance at the job as U.S. ones. This would mean that it would be unethical to NOT hire Indian programmers just because they have a lower salary.
Based on all of this information, I argue that it is not necessarily unethical to hire Indian programmers, as long as it is determined that they are equally qualified for the position. Unfortunately, as it was mentioned earlier in this analysis, being “qualified” for a position can be difficult to determine. I argue that, for a job such as a programmer, being “qualified” would entail being able to solve rigorous interview questions relevant to the job. If either party can answer the questions correctly, they should be equally considered for the job.
Before doing this analysis, I would most likely have argued that it would be unethical to hire the Indian programmers. This opinion would have come from a variety of things, but mainly from personal experience. A few summers ago, I worked as a Software Development Intern, where the vast majority of our software development team was in India, specifically Bangalore. From my experience, the only reason why a company would ever hire developers like that would be to save money, which is not ethical. The quality of work was extremely questionable, and accomplishing any task took far longer that it should have. The difference in time zones was also extremely difficult, and it made almost all communication on an asynchronous basis which caused so much confusion.
Of course, had the Indian developers we hired be properly qualified for the position, I’m sure I would have far less complaints. Going off of this, I maintain my new analysis that it would not necessarily be unethical to fire the Indian programmers if they were qualified. That being said, I don’t think it is realistic to imagine a company NOT hiring the Indian programmers if they have the proper infrastructure to support it. As I was led to understand from my coworkers, they would command a salary that was ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE lower than any U.S. employees, which would cause us to have more developers as a result. If we had hired U.S. programmers, we may have only had a couple programmers, but because it was outsourced, the same budget got dozens of Indian developers. This sad truth is unfortunately a reality, and I don’t see an easy way in the real world to have it be ethical.
However, if this problem were to be analyzed from a classic Utilitarianism view, it would certainly be ethical to hire the Indian developers. According to John Stuart, an act is just it causes the “the greatest happiness for the greatest number.” In this instance, it is very true that the quality of life of the developers hired in India was significantly raised, far more than the U.S. ones would have if they acquired the same job. If this were the true reason a company hires them, then perhaps it would be ethical.
In conclusion, whether or not it is ethical to hire the Indian programmers depends almost entirely upon whatever lens you use to analyze the issue. However, as was the point of this essay, when viewed from the views of John Rawls, I believe it would not be necessarily unethical, given the proper conditions. However, as stated previously, I do not believe that most – if any – companies would be hiring for ethical reasons, as money is the driving factor in most cases.","SOURCES

September 15th, 2020","Throughout its many years of use, capitalism drives the actions of many in the countries utilizing it. The idea of capitalism is shown in many different ways depending on which country you visit. For purposes of discussion, only American capitalism will be covered. With the use of this economic system, a trickling effect is noted. The decisions of higher-ups within a company impact the lives of many, especially the average citizen. Or in the case of many tech companies, the lives of non-citizens. The ethics of hiring foreign nationals is dicey, considering which countries a company is hiring employees from. On one hand it could be seen as almost charitable to hire employees and fly them out of their home country on a work visa for an opportunity for a better life. On the other hand, this can be viewed as taking advantage of unfortunate situations of other countries in order to maximize company profits with cheap exported labor. In most cases, it appears to be the latter. American capitalism has many faults, one of the biggest being its total lack of regard for ethical practices without government interference. Exploring the theories of John Rawls, Thomas Hobbes, and Kant, one can determine the ethicality of hiring foreign workers into American tech companies.
In order to discuss the ethicality of American hiring practices, one must look into the incentive to hire foreign nationals into American companies: Capitalism. Capitalism as defined by Merriam-Webster is,
“...an economic system characterized by private or corporate ownership of capital goods, by investments that are determined by private decision, and by prices, production, and the distribution of goods that are determined mainly by competition in a free market.”
A very important concept of capitalism is the idea of “...competition in a free market.” It is essential that companies maximize profits while maintaining low prices in order to compete with the prices of other similar companies. This competition provides an incentive to seek out ways to lessen the cost of production. Lessening the costs of production may include: importing supplies from different countries, utilizing cheap labor of other countries, making special deals with supplying companies, etc. By lessening the cost of production, companies can maximize profit margins, leaving very pleased CEOs. However this comes at a cost, the livelihood and autonomy of the average worker. In the case of modern tech companies, the average programmer. Programming is a highly sought out skill that is required to help companies function in this age. Companies need highly skilled programmers to optimize programs used for daily business functions and are willing to pay these individuals well for their hard work. Employees of top tech companies such as Facebook and Google report very comfortable salaries and amenities for their position as a programmer. Salaries starting at six figures for programmers straight out of university. For multi-billion dollar companies such as FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google) this expense is trivial. For struggling start-up companies or even the average multi-million dollar business this salary is very taxing to profits. This leaves companies with a choice, to either cut out their budget for programmers by hiring less American ones and skimping on the benefits of having their expertise. Or they can hire work from other countries such as India, China, Korea, and Japan for significantly less and reap the benefits of having more programmers and saving money on labor. From a business perspective, this is the perfect scenario. From an ethical perspective, this is highly controversial.
Experts across many fields have discussed the pros and cons of hiring foreign workers. Returning to the different ways one could view the situation, companies trying to maximize profits for the betterment of the company as a whole can be seen as noble and the “right” thing to do. Applying Kant’s concept of utilitarianism, the means (foreign workers) may justify the end (maximum profits). In order to find out if this statement holds, we must look into what actually happens when profits are maximized within a company. Does everyone reap the benefits or just the highest ranking employees? If everyone benefits and only the foreign workers are harmed in the eyes of Kant this is an ethical exchange. Considering the budgeting practices of certain companies, specifically Amazon underpaying even American workers. It appears to be unlikely everyone benefits from the success of the company. Amazon is one of many multi-billion dollar corporations that despite its huge success it appears the wealth never trickles down to the lowest of the ladder. If this is true for other companies, specifically ones that utilize foreign labor, according to Kant this is an unethical practice. Since more people end up worse off than those who benefit, the end does not justify the means.
Concerning the ethics of hiring foreign nationals, one can make a connection to the ideas of John Rawls and Thomas Hobbes. The Social Contract, written by Hobbes and further elaborated by Rawls covers the relationship between the governing body and the average citizen of a nation. The exchange of power and autonomy for protection and governing. Although The Social Contract was written with the intention of reaching the average citizen, there is a point that could be made between the governing body and businesses. If you think of a business like a human in this scenario, the same concepts can be applied. Hobbes refers to a “state of nature” which involves chaos. A world without government interference also allows businesses to have free reign over how much they pay or how they treat their employees. Without the government explicitly saying you must do x, it’s been shown that business will cut corners in order to keep themselves successful. Even if this comes at a cost of the workers. This social contract must be upheld between the business and the government in order to have an environment where hiring foreign nationals is even worth the cost. In this hypothetical world where businesses have all control over how much they pay and who they hire. They would just hire American citizens and underpay them in order to maximize profits. Fortunately for America, the system in place allows for people at the bottom of the ladder to make a living. Unfortunately it opens up opportunities to also exploit those at the bottom, especially foreign labor.
Overall, this question of whether or not hiring foreign nationals to your tech company is ethical or not is difficult to answer. As mentioned before, there are two ways you could look at this scenario. One in a negative light, with sympathy for the workers involved. Another in a positive light, praising the economic success of American tech companies. As always with ethics, things are situational. A rare situation will always arise where it may contradict the norm. However this situation is highly unlikely and American capitalism’s desire for profit margins will supersede employee benefits. In a perfect world there is a definitive answer to whether or not an action one would take is morally right or wrong. If life was entirely black and white as so there wouldn’t be a need for a discussion of this sort. For now the world is left with this for an answer: In most cases, yes it is.","Works Cited

as465988,,"Computer ethics is a part of practical philosophy concerned with how computing professionals should make decisions regarding professional and social conduct. Firstly, when I heard about the term computer ethics it made me confuse because I always think that ethics is a term related to the social issues. But this course made me fully understand about the importance of ethics in computer field. Since we know that the ethics is a set of moral principles that govern the behavior of a group or individual. Similarly, computer ethics is how those principles relate to the use of computers in an ethical way for example how to handle the certain things just because we can access it. There are certain limitations on how one can access others privacy, security in an ethical way. There are some important stuffs that really needs to be concerned are: To conserve moral and social values by protecting unwanted spams that happens in our daily life like ethical hacking, accessing people’s information, stopping from fraud and the use of copyrighted material and to suppress dishonest business practices and to protect and encourage fair competition. These kinds of activities define the behavior of the computing industries.
John Rawls, a twentieth-century American philosopher came to an action when we had a hard time explaining our sense of injustice to the powers that be in a way that sounds rational and without personal pique or bitterness. He provided us with a failproof model for identifying what truly might be unfair and how we might gather support for fixings things. As per my research, he was inspired from shocking poverty in the United States and the death of his brothers from an illness and horrors and lawlessness of the Second World War. To do this, he joined college and used the power of ideas to change the unjust world he was living in. In addition to that, he introduced a ‘Veil of Ignorance’ concept to imagine staying behind veil of ignorance which is if we knew nothing about where we’d end up, what sort of a society would it feel safe to enter? This concept can be considered as a very useful tool to find the ethical and social issues going around the community. He might not be 100% accurate but he guided us, or these tools can be useful to find how society works. Nowadays, people being more educated, they come up with the different opinions/ideas on how the systems in the world works. In this essay, I am going to talk about how I as an educated person can come up with the new ideas. Below, I am going to write how the concepts of Rawls is going to be applied on ethics of hiring foreign workers.
Hiring foreign employees is one of the tough contents now a days around the whole world.
You will find foreign worker in every nook and corner of the world whether they are working legally or illegally. There has always been a dilemma considering the pros and cons of foreign workers. Many employers have been profited by them and many companies have been doomed due to the foreign workers. Before we move on to the analysis of the scenario about whether to hire US programmers or Indian programmers, I want to use a John Rawls political philosophy how we can help our own citizens so that everyone could settle their lives successfully. That being said, there are lots and lots of programmers in US. Our country/Society would be politically and economically strong if we hired a programmer of our own country. But the dilemma here is, some of Indian programmers will be ready to work for less amount. The Indian programmers might not know they were paying less than the US programmer but the manager might have taken the advantage of the Indian Programmers. Some people believe that it is unfair because there are lots of Indian programmers in India. To save money, if the US company manager handed all of the projects to the Indian, then the US programmer will be out of job which would make their life tough. Also, that would impact the society, community and the whole nation. But according to the Utilitarianism concept by John Rawls, as long as Indian programmers are happy, manager is happy, and customers are happy with the products then it shouldn’t matter whether the programmers are Indian or American. According to Gild’s data (IT Olympics, held on September 2010), Indian programmer appear to be better at math and logic than American programmers. But Americans were good at programming like web programming, software development, communications and software development skills. This doesn’t mean that all Indian programmers are good at math and logic and all American are good at programming. In my opinion, if the Indian programmers completed their project within the time that the manager asked them to finish then they deserve the equal respect, equal salary and so on. If I was the manager, then I would have played as fair. game. There are some others way how the Indian programmers could aid US nation in the ethics of computing industries. By staying behind the “Veil of Ignorance”, let’s take an example of the CEO of Google “Sundar Pichai”, he was an Indian programmer came to US for his education on student visa. After completion of his study, He started working for the companies. By staying behind the veil of ignorance, nobody knew he was that smart and talent, but the interviewers handed him a job, now he is an US citizen and a CEO of Google. He has helped US nation to be more popular in the Technology sector. He helped lots of people getting job from all over the nation especially people from US. Like him, there are lots of other Indian programmers in US as well and they are working in the Big companies like Google, Facebook, Tesla and so on. So, if we look at this way, then the ethics in computing due to the Indian workers has moved in a good way. But it does have a negative social impact on society. foreign worker staying in US might have different behavior, morals from the residents from US. They might follow different religion, culture and traditions. The people from US may not like it which might bring social issues related to religion, culture and tradition. This sort of things might impact on the social ethics.
Utilitarianism concept has lots of approach in the field of computer IT. The decision-making framework of the managing ethics has been attained through analytical decision process used in business and it has explored the dilemma by solving problems by using utilitarian approach ensuring that the maximum number of people are benefited/favored by the decision. The “Veil of Ignorance” concept has brought out that we could take Utilitarianism concept into play only when we are ready to let someone be subjected to terms and conditions which we would not have been prepared to subject ourself. Since we all are equal in the eyes of god, we all are equal in our positions and our desires. The principle of John Rawls applies to all since everybody has same liberties and opportunities. For example, Indian programmers are just from different country. He has the same right as we do. During a competition, the manager may work with the Indian programmers because he may be playing fair game by eliminating all forms of race, origin, social standards and beliefs. He might have followed the principle of justice.",,1262

9/11/20","It is important to not neglect the ethical side of computing. It is often overlooked and never really thought of by the end user, nor many aspiring workers in the fields of technology and computing. Having ethical work conditions, payment and treatment are paramount no matter what the industry. Therefore, having a solid foundation in ethics from which you can pull different viewpoints from is important to have in computing considering it is not something you often hear about.
The issue of hiring U.S. or Indian programmers opens up a lot of questions. Many of which are hard or impossible to answer definitively. What can be done however, is to look at the issues from different perspectives including the ones already laid out by past prominent figures in ethics. Whether that be using consequentialism/utilitarianism, Kant with deontology, or John Rawls with the “veil of ignorance”. While you may agree with one more than the other, they are all just perspectives to be used and can actually enhance one another and are not necessarily at odds with one another. It’s good to use them all to gain a complete picture before you come to your own personal conclusion.
Now to look at this problem through the lens of the different ethical perspectives available to us. Utilitarianism, which is also commonly used interchangeably with consequentialism, is an ethical “barometer” or guideline which states that whatever creates the most good or “utility” in the end is the best and most ethical option. Looking at the issue through the lens of consequentialism, one could really go one or the other way on what is the best option, because there’s definite pros and cons to both options and there is no real measure of what will actually increase net happiness/good/utility. Hiring the Indian programmers could definitely allow them to rise above their current standards which would be great for them and their families. But then again, the Indian programmers would most likely be being put to work in not the best conditions for much less than what their U.S. counterparts would be getting paid. The U.S. programmers could also use that money for them and their families so the argument could really go both ways there. This is where deontology would say that it is morally unethical to allow companies to hire them for less money for cheaper in less safe work environments because that is not a business model you would want everybody/every company to follow. It’s not a good principle to stand by, hardly a principle at all really. It’s about getting the cheapest labor, with the highest return on investment and profit. It’s quite a hedonistic business model and one we see all the time these days. We’ve seen the effects of this and how H1B visa abuse has basically reintroduced modern slavery (Lapinig) through the exertion of control over foreign workers who have not much to gain (compared to U.S. workers compensation) and everything to lose (getting sent back to their country).
John Rawls used a thought experiment called the veil of ignorance to try and get people to imagine what it would be like to be in someone else’s shoes. The idea is that if you were unborn but still a conscious being, but didn’t know where you would end up in life, what and where would you like to end up and why is that? It is clear that only statistically speaking, only a select few are able to achieve “The American Dream” and achieve massive success. There are many in society with clear disadvantages compared to the rest and it’s not right to just turn a blind eye to them as many do. If you didn’t know where you’d end up there are definitely circumstances you would rather not be born into since they are just obviously much harder. Rawls’ whole point of the thought experiment was to try to get people who never thought about it much, to think about the disadvantaged in life. Often people never really think about those less fortunate than them because it’s out of sight, out of mind for a lot of people. But by utilizing the veil of ignorance, it forces you to look at how unequal and skewed the “game” of life really is.
You can use the veil of ignorance to look at the problem of hiring Indian programmers over U.S. programmers. Yes, if you were born in India it would be nice to have the opportunity to escape the circumstances you were born into but on the other hand would you want to have to know that one of the only chances you have to make it out of said circumstances is to work overseas in America for less than your U.S. counterparts with worse working conditions? This shows us that yes you could technically say that these tech companies are doing something “good” for the Indian programmers but at the same they shouldn’t even have to be in that position in the first place. Some starling facts to put into perspective what is going on in the tech world (mainly) with H1B abuse are that “13 outsourcing companies took nearly one-third of all H-1B visas in 2014” (Park), most H1B workers’ salaries are below market rate and a majority of said workers are from India. It’s clear to see that an abuse of power is happening here. It is usually also done under the guise of finding talent which they have a hard time finding here in the U.S. but that is not the case. There are tons of Americans who willing and able and would love to employed by these tech companies, but they know that citizens have more freedom to up and leave when they please and they’d much rather have a guaranteed worker who they can exert control over, since for most companies it’s only about the bottom line.
Personally, I don’t agree with the hiring of overseas programmers over U.S. programmers. There is the argument that it is beneficial for the Indian people over there but it’s a short-sighted argument in my opinion. There is not as much of a shortage of talent in the U.S. to warrant the amount of H1B applications submitted to the government by these tech companies that ship these jobs out overseas. It’s just not right to hire these people for less money and in worse conditions just so a company can turn a higher profit. That’s the only reason they’re doing it, it has nothing to do with enriching the lives of foreign workers for them, and intent matters. I usually side with the ethical perspective of deontology because the golden rule that everyone’s heard is “treat others how you’d want to be treated” which is basically deontology in a nutshell. Do the right thing and have a set of principles that you stand by. Principle and intent go hand-in-hand, and that, to me, outweighs whatever possible positive side effects can come from morally flawed decision making.","Bibliography:

Societal and Ethical Implications of Computing
9/14/2020","The importance of ethics for the industry of computing will not have the first say but will follow the precedent set in other sectors of government and economy. Technology is growing faster than we can manage and faster than we know what to do with it. Due to this nature, the industry cannot be regulated before its impacts. This will continue to cause problems for the foreseeable future – likely until a new form of government or economy are adopted. No system has been proven to be better at scale like our current system have – a paradox that plagues every apex in society. All changes are guaranteeing a risk. However, the utility of computing runs out of our grasp further with each day.
Data privacy and management hold incredible amounts of problems and solutions. Yet the rate at which we collect data escapes our grasp at a skyrocketing rate. What we do know is that ethics for the industry of computing will have the last say if there is one. Therefore, the computing industry must delay its judgement and proceed with caution until its importance is undeniable, and its word becomes law.
In the world of data, privacy is a concern that is not solved. On one hand, we have incredible amounts of data already existing. On the other, we have even more amounts of data being collected every day. Identity graphs struggle to keep up with the rate at which we track data, and we use machine learning in all sorts of unexplainable ways to try to figure out what we can use the data for. The main concern is that having too much data is obviously detrimental and not a desirable outcome. Information holds too much power in the wrong hands and yet, information is available about almost everyone in the united states for the right price.
Rawls’ idea that justice is centered around fairness through a contract with society is related to data privacy in that fairness is difficult to achieve when information is freely available to those in power. Fairness does not favor the privileged. Justice as defined by Benn Steil and Manuel Hinds, means treating individuals according to identical rules of conduct. This is actively discouraged from the position of power and makes no sense in today’s world.
To apply this idea, consider a small company going into competition with a large company when the large company can see the small company’s hand. While the small company may see the large company’s hand, there is no power that can be exercised. The large company will and must file lawsuits and do everything it can to stomp out any infringements to provide and secure value for stakeholders. In the reverse scenario, the small company cannot do anything about it. Their data is the large company’s data.","References

09/14/2020","Abstract
The purpose of this paper is to analyze a scenario where the manager at a software company in the United States is about to start a large project that will require the hiring of dozens of programmers. The manager has the choice to hire Indian programmers abroad that he can pay less, or to hire American programmers. This paper will address why it is unethical from a Rawlsian standpoint to hire Indian programmers, due to the negative impact it could have on both the international and domestic workers’ human rights and civil liberties.
For the last century, the world has become increasingly globalized. Invaluable technological advances have made international contact so simple that American companies can easily hire workers from foreign countries that will produce cheaper labor and enable them to maximize their profits and efficiency. A prime example of this is the offshoring of software companies, who hire international workers for a lower price than they would have to pay domestic workers. While this can be beneficial to a company, it does pose several ethical and moral issues. One ethical issue is the impact that offshoring jobs will have on domestic workers by giving away jobs that they could be hired for. Most domestic workers would argue this it is immoral to give away jobs that benefit another country when we have perfectly capable workers that contribute to our country. Another ethical issue still is the impact on the international workers who get outsourced. Companies who hire internationally to maximize their profits often hire from countries that do not have sufficient business regulation to hire these workers, posing a significant likelihood that these workers will get taken advantage of. This paper will address the scenario of why it is unethical for a manager at a software company in the United States to hire programmers from India instead of American programmers, due to the negative impacts that it could have on both international and domestic workers’ human rights and liberties.
Offshoring and its Effects on American Programmers
Offshoring can be defined the practice of replacing domestically supplied services with imported services.At first glance, offshoring these jobs to Indian programmers may appear as an appealing decision. It has the potential to benefit the software company who would hire these Indian Programmers from a financial standpoint, providing more affordable labor and maximizing profit. This in turn may lead to cheaper products to benefit American consumers, which could also be considered beneficial. However, these savings will come at the cost of the American programmers that could have been hired for these positions and therefore raises ethical issues. America is founded on the back of capitalism, and the American dream is that anybody can have anything as long as they work hard enough. Offshoring enables those running this company to achieve this dream due to their profit maximization, but the domestic workers who will not be able to get these jobs certainly cannot. These American programmers are no longer guaranteed what the American dream promised them, through no fault of their own. According to the Constitutional Rights Foundation, American programmers averaged about $70,000 per year while those in India earned about $8,000 in 2004. This steep wage difference leaves American programmers at a significant disadvantage, the potential to maximize profit would obviously make the Indian programmers a better choice for the company.
Capitalism’s Impact on the Collective Social Justice Contract
One could argue from a utilitarian perspective that offshoring stands to benefit everyone since these Indian programmers get job opportunities that were not available and maximize profits and lowering product costs to American consumers. But it also infringes upon the rights of the American programmers that are now left without the gainful employment these jobs could have provided them. Julian Friedland states that capitalism leaves ownership and hence distribution much more in the hands of the private sector. As a result, business has a much greater degree of responsibility to voluntarily uphold its obligations to the collective social contract justice requires. Therefore, it seems unjust to give these jobs to citizens from a different country over citizens who participate in the social institutions of our country that ultimately create these very jobs. Yet in this case, capitalism has forced them into a corner. They are unable to live in this capitalistic society on the wages the company could pay an Indian programmer, despite being equally qualified for the job, and they cannot change the cost of living in their country.
By Rawlsian standards, this is considered an infringement upon their rights, as it prevents these American programmers from securing employment and being considered equal candidates in their field. A proper political system protects basic civil liberties such as the freedom to choose your occupation, but these programmers that abide by the American political structure will be unable to work in the occupation that they have trained for. Furthermore, the Indian programmers who have not provided any contribution to the social institutions are benefitting instead. This is an infringement on the civil liberties of the American programmers, as they are law-abiding citizens that adhere to their responsibilities in this collective social justice contract and it is failing to give them the rights and liberties promised to them for doing so.
Offshoring and its Effects on India’s Society
Offshoring industry in India plays a critical role in the Indian economy through providing employment opportunities to a large number of people and development of infrastructure, according to Shashank Dinkar and Dr. Lovy Sarikwal. While one may think that choosing to hire the Indian programmers would provide them with substantial gain, they too face negative effects from these jobs. Perhaps the most obvious ethical dilemma is that while these Indian programmers are getting gainful employment, they too are facing significant injustice according to Rawlsian philosophy. They are getting hired at a significantly lower salary than an American programmer has the potential to earn and would likely not get the job if they asked for the same salary. Therefore, they are not being considered as equals to the American programmers and capitalism has also forced them into a corner, albeit a different one.
Another ethical dilemma is the potential impact that may occur on their traditions and social structure by hiring these Indian programmers. The surge of offshoring has caused an indirect societal impact in India since 70% of the population lives in rural areas, which in turn has shaped a gap among urban and rural settings. This change has forced residents of these rural villages to migrate to the cities for survival. The migration of people destroys the villages, their culture, and have adverse effects on agriculture of the country. Therefore, hiring these Indian programmers would be considered unethical from a Rawlsian standpoint, since it has the potential to cause more harm than good to the majority of the country’s population and the right of their citizens to live a traditional lifestyle if they choose to.
Offshoring has experienced significant growth in our ever-expanding world. While this has undeniably benefitted society as a whole in certain aspects, it has also infringed on the rights and liberties of individuals living in the countries involved due to the negative effects at the expense of the individual citizens who help these very companies in their successes. Therefore, the manager of this company should hire the American programmers since it is ultimately unethical to put profits before individuals, or else globalization will be at risk and we may lose the wonderful benefits it has provided to the world.","References

Date: 9/15/2020","With the introduction of computers, the personal and social life of everyone on this planet has been profoundly altered. Technology has always influenced people’s lives, but on a very visible scale: tools and materials were within the power of the craftsman or the user. However, Computers are universal tools which can be shaped to perform nearly any task. People find them everywhere: first of all on our desks, but more and more in daily life appliances: the fridge, the micro-wave, the lighting, the car…but also in the workplace, in education, in health care, in political and military life, in the world of business and banking, in the media.
Computers are black boxes which contain programmes and data that are almost invisible unless one has an apparatus that can read the bits and bytes as ‘information’. Information is processed data which are done by programmes. People find it as illegible bits and bytes on machine level. But as human beings we can give meaning to this information so that information becomes knowledge, which can have an effective impact on people and society, for the better or for the worse.
A further complex problem emerges when computers transform information into commands for machines and apparatus without any human interference. The impact of it can make operations for the better or for the worse much faster, much larger, much broader, much longer in time,… than what people can foresee, and, possibly, that they can stop when some limits are exceeded. How do we protect ourselves against dangers caused by the computer apparatus?
And what role do people have? Is the human only a burden of the more and more autonomous machine? Or are people not only the inventor, but also the ultimate controller of what happens there? Are people the aim of the computer process and is the computer only the means or is it vice versa?
All those poses serious ethical dilemmas, exacerbating old problems and forcing us to readjust ordinary moral standards in new fields.
As a result, People cannot deny the importance of ethics for the industry of computing.
The world is currently experiencing a wave of globalization. New technologies, like IT, are leading to greater interconnectivity across national borders. Companies no longer are limited to domestic markets and increasingly target foreign consumers to turn a profit. Similarly, more and more companies are moving their business processes aboard, where the operating costs are much lower than in the United States.
For example, because the recent downturn in the United States economy, numerous American companies to begin offshoring work to other countries. India is the number one country for United States corporate offshoring. One of the main reasons that the jobs are offshored aboard to developing countries such as India is because they have a lower standard of living compared to other countries. This means that the wages, safety, and health laws are lenient, which gives them the ability to compete on price.
However, this practice has also caused intensified controversy in the United States. Because these foreign workers work for cheaper wages, many American worker loss their job, that has created an increasing nativist sentiment, with many in favor of more stringent tariffs on goods being imported. On the other hand, those who are in favor of offshoring tend to argue that the practice allows companies to maximize the efficiency of the production that will create more benefits to everyone over the long-term.
The purpose of this essay aims to analyze offshoring from social contract theory, which developed by John Rawls who is the most influential contemporary proponent of social contract theory, as he develops it further in his book A Theory of Justice. I will argue that offshoring in its current state is not ethical from the ideas of Rawls and will offer suggestions on how the practice can be made more ethical.
According to A Theory of Justice, Paralleling Hobbes’s state of nature, Rawls describes a hypothetical situation that he calls the original position. In this position, we are neither at war with one another nor trying to start a government, but just a group of rational and self-interested people who want to devise a mutually beneficial rule of society.
And to help ourselves arrive at the fairest social order, we temporarily ignore our actual status in society, such as the size of our bank accounts or the amount of property that we own. Like, it is as though we voluntarily stand behind a veil of ignorance. This assures that someone will not try to manipulate the system to create the rule of society that benefit him or her the most, whether this person is rich or poor.
Base on this idea, after some back-and-forth discussion, people will eventually arrive at two rules of justice. First, we should give one another as much freedom as we can. This includes freedom of speech and free choice of occupation, but also economic liberties, such as acquiring property and making money. Second, the social and economic inequalities should be to be deal. According to this rule, rich people can have an unequal amount of wealth only if such an economic system that is ensure everyone’s advantage, including poor people.
In Rawls’ view, all companies are ethically obligated to enhance the overall welfare of society by following a social contract between the society and the business. On the other words, if the society is not going to benefit from those companies’ existence, members of society are not willing to authorize those companies to exist.
Under the theory, offshoring to be ethical must satisfy that members of society are going to gain social welfare from the practice. However, from the American employee who were replaced, offshoring will not significantly improve their welfare, but on the contrary, it worsen their situation.
An opponent is likely to reply at this point that this example short-sighted excludes consideration of those workers abroad who stand to beneﬁt from oﬀshoring. However, In the Law of People, Rawls unambiguously points out that no people is prepared to count the beneﬁts for another people as outweighing the hardships imposed on itself.
According to the social contract theory, it entirely irrational not to root rights and obligations in a collective social contract by, for, and of, a special community. So, the companies created in the interests of a given society are entirely beholden to the citizens of that nation.
The fault of the utilitarian doctrine is that it mistakes impersonality for impartiality, John Rawls also states. Therefore essentially, the American employee are under no obligation to increase the availability of good jobs in other societies, such as Indian.
Thus, on this reasoning, it entirely irrational and unjust to turn over every offshorable job to the people of another society which have not any participated in the establishment of the social contract. And if companies did not try to curb this trend, that government regulations should intervene to keep the trend from continuing.
In the conclusion, the social contract theory would most certainly against companies to use offshoring. The practice disproportionately benefits a smaller number of stockholders, at the expense of numerous employees facing the prospect of job loss. It clearly cannot satisfy the requirement of social contract, so offshoring is unethical and American companies should consider the welfare of domestic programmers more than Indian programmers.","REFERENCES

September 14, 2020","ABSTRACT: Decision makers in the tech industry have the choice to keep development onshore, or outsource work to India. To make the most ethically sound decision, they can utilize John Rawls’ thought experiment, the Veil of Ignorance. Doing so, it becomes apparent that it is ideal from a utilitarian perspective to send work offshore.
The ideal future of the software industry is not shaped by wind or water, but instead by the entrepreneurs and decision makers who decide what path their company will take, as a constituent in the industry as a whole. This industry comprises companies, which in turn comprise individuals, all of whom have lives of varying qualities and circumstances. To have a positive and vibrant industry means to have happy and responsible workers at the individual level, and decision makers at the corporate level have the opportunity to make decisions which positively affect those workers. To a company, outsourcing may put development out of sight and mind, but the offshoring of employees does not cease their inclusion in the industry, and their welfare is therefore not to be neglected in this vision. As the decision to outsource is so complex in nature and can be guided by a plethora of potentially conflicting maxims, we default to utilitarianism as the theory from which to approach it, as corresponds well with the principles of John Rawls. Approaching the dilemma of whether companies should utilize onshore talent or offshore talent in India while utilizing Rawls’ popular ‘Veil of Ignorance’ thought experiment yields one answer only: indeed, it is acceptable for a company to outsource to India.
There is no lack of existing debate about the offshoring dilemma, and we can apply our utilitarian judgment to both sides. Opponents of offshoring are quick to rebuke its very real benefits, claiming that putting money overseas is supporting lower pay and decreased benefits and environmental conditions, states Ariana Hajmiragha of Brandeis University [1]. She additionally depicts the misconception that sending work offshore means less jobs onshore, as the number of available jobs actually increases in both countries in the case of offshoring, because the money saved in talent sourcing typically does not get turned into profit, but instead reinvested into higher paying jobs onshore in other departments like research and development as well as marketing [1]. To that end, onshore jobs are preserved by outsourcing because to pay higher wages for lower productivity onshore means to be at a disadvantage, which could mean being driven out of the market altogether. From our ethical, utilitarian perspective, we see that outsourcing is ideal for both economic security and job availability, which means the most good is done for the most people when companies outsource, the ideal situation in the consequential eye. This simple utilitarian approach fails however to settle the dilemma objectively.
John Rawls’ concept of the Veil of Ignorance addresses this concern. Timothy Henry and Sara Baase explain in A Gift of Fire that modern philosopher John Rawls expanded social contract theory, with an emphasis on claim right to ensure that individuals get an equal opportunity to access their civil liberties [2]. They explain the thought experiment that Rawls created that can be used to measure policies and decisions: the Veil of Ignorance. An interpreter or policymaker can wear a metaphorical veil that prevents them from seeing any of their own identifying features or circumstances. Applying the policy or decision in question to the world or situation, the interpreter can determine if everyone in society, including themselves, is benefited, and if so, the decision is good [2]. If they knew not who they would be in the world when they took off the veil, they would ensure that their policies would positively affect all. Samuel Freeman of Stanford University explains that the interpreter with this veil occupies the “original position” whereby he knows all that humanity knows about natural sciences including biology, economics, philosophy, et cetera [3]. The intention of the interpreter is to secure two interests through the observed decision or policy: the guarantee of equal rights and liberties for all, and the equality of educational and employment opportunities [3]. Certainly the latter interest is more applicable to the dilemma at hand, however the former can be applied to it as the betterment of life through employment nurtures an individual’s ability to defend their liberties.
This Veil of Ignorance can be an incredibly useful tool in the analysis of our dilemma. Utilizing our veil, we note that we now have no interest in subjectively choosing onshore labor or offshore labor either as the ideal route for the company. We compare the outcomes of both decisions. If we decide that the company should keep labor onshore, we provide jobs for the Americans that live near the company, and the company pays the going rate for software engineering talent. The company can only afford so many of these developers, so there is no money left over to be reinvested in other parts of the business. If from our “original position,” as Rawls labels it, we turned out to be an American developer, we would be satisfied with our job but the company would be struggling to compete in the market with other companies utilizing outsourcing, so that would certainly make us uneasy. From this original position, if we turned out to be an Indian developer that didn’t get the job, we would be devastated by the lack of income in an already impoverished area, making it hard to feed ourselves and our families, and tying us up to try to find another, less satisfactory job. This does not meet the first interest of policy that Rawls described, as struggling to get by makes defending one’s liberties a challenge. Nor does it support the second interest, as for the Indian programmers to not have the chance to compete for those jobs is inherently a lack of employment opportunity. On the other hand, say the company does choose to outsource the labor to India. The issue of only one group getting the jobs seems to persist, with only Indians getting these jobs, but such is not the case, because the money saved in development opens up new jobs in America, so both countries get job positions. This inherently satisfies interest number two of Rawls’ model, and by extension satisfies the first as well. It is evident that if we, behind the veil, did not know if we were an American developer on an Indian one, we would be better off in all cases if we had the company outsource to India.
These results do, in part, conflict with what I had thought before utilizing Rawls’ thought experiment. I thought it was ideal to keep talent and labor onshore to benefit our economy and allow Indian companies to do the same. The Veil of Ignorance has allowed me to see beyond my biases and choose a fairer outcome for all involved parties, and as it has helped me, it can undoubtedly help others as well, specifically business owners who are looking for more talent to add to their companies. They can see these results discovered with the veil, and determine that it is the most fair and ethical decision to offshore before even taking into consideration the other aspects for their businesses, be them practical or financial.
In a world of options, we as decision makers in the software industry have the opportunity to shape the future, doing so in a way that is most fair and ethical for all. It is evident that utilizing John Rawls’ Veil of Ignorance allows us to determine what that ethical outcome should be, and the decisions necessary to manifest it. All decision makers in the tech industry can support this positive effort for fairness by making the decision to outsource talent from India, and we see the utilitarian benefit from them doing so in the qualities of life for all parties involved. It is impossible to avoid making necessary decisions in this industry, but with the theories of ethics and the tools of Rawls, we are well equipped to do so.","References

09/12/2020","The computing industry is a rapidly expanding industry that contains a widely diverse group of individuals. And when you have these two elements the question of ethics comes into play. Ethics is defined as “moral principles that govern a person’s behavior or the conductions of an activity.” In the example of whether to hire American or Indian programmers, we can demonstrate different situations on how a company might view its ethics. These are two different groups of individuals living under different sets of laws and standards. So, for one to assume that pay and conditions for one group are suitable for the other is not ethically justifiable. The most obvious debate is if you outsource the jobs to India would it be for lower or same wages as it would be to hire in the United States, but there are other factors to take into considerations such as working conditions and insurance benefits.
I believe that if I were person hiring these programmers to complete a project for the company, the only factors that I would put into consideration is who can get the job done best in the amount of time allotted. The decision should be made for the best interest of the company and the consumers of the product. There should not be an ethical dilemma based on selfish interests on the company’s behalf. These decisions affect people’s lives and they should be treated as such. There are many differences between American work live and Indian work life and I think that companies need to be taking that into consideration when making decisions. There are other factors that create a question of ethics, but the bottom line is that companies should hire individuals based on a set of principles that are deemed ethical. Or there should even be law that requires companies to only outsource if certain condition and fair wages are met. Too often jobs are outsourced to India and most of the time it isn’t ethically justifiable, but corporations tend not to look to closely.
John Rawls was a political philosopher who had a theory of justice as fairness. Which basically states a society of free citizens holding equal basic rights and cooperating within an egalitarian economic system. [1] This theory is broken down into two parts. The first part is fair equality of opportunity, which ensures that positions are available to all no matter the race, gender or background. And the second part is difference principle,  which regulates work economics by assuring worst off in society a fair deal. This theory means that there should not be a divide of rights or pay between two different groups just based on their in this case, ethnicity. But that all individuals should be in one basic society where all aspects are considered equal. When it comes to the idea of who to hire, Rawls’ idea suggests that both groups should be considered equal on all aspects of the job. Meaning that the pay and the workload should all be the same.
People tend to get hung up on the fact that the pay is less for Indian workers, but that may not be entirely true. According to Ashley Zimmerman, with the fact that goods are cheaper in India and the conversion rate from USD to Rupees is high, then the pay for Indian programmers might not be as different than American programmers. [2] So the more logical question would be whether or not the ratio of amount paid for the job and the most of living is similar for both groups. Seeing as cost of living is the way that the government determines wages, it would only be fair that the company honors the amount paid to the cost of living in India as they would in America. For arguments sake if after all things considered the pay is lower, then it should be expected that these workers workload would be less significant. Just like pay and cost of living should be correlated, so should workload and pay.
The more important ethical question to be concerned about would be how working conditions and the lack of health insurance for Indian workers. Many people when hearing about wages that programmers make tend to forget that there are benefits that go along with the job, and these benefits can add up to thousands. Not only that but these benefits, like health insurance are a crucial component seeing as we live in a society without universal health care. And we have to assume that when looking to hire the Indian programmers they are most likely not given these benefits that would be awarded to American workers. This raises the question on whether it would be ethical to give these programmers these benefits or to even hire these programmers solely based on the fact that the company would cut costs by excluding health insurance from the job. Most of these workers in India are most likely not on a health insurance plan, so would it be unreasonable to the company to give these benefits along with the job?
The other side of the coin is working conditions. The United States law requires certain standard of working conditions that companies must provide for their employees. But this might not be the case for workers in India if the company chooses to hire the programmers from there. They could be working in unconditioned environment, overcrowded spaces, unsanitary workplace’s, etc. The ethical question that is brought up is, can one hire these employees knowing that they aren’t going to working under same conditions that an American employee might expect. It would be unrealistic to assume that the conditions would be exactly the same. Although the person doing the hiring cannot control the working conditions for the workers in India, it could provide an opportunity for conditions to improve. By setting certain standards or outsourcing to companies that follow ethical work conditions would be a way to ethically hire these employees.
Ethics are a very controversial and intricate topic of conversation. In the process of hiring American vs Indian workers, we should treat all as if we existed in an equal society as Rawls describes. We shouldn’t get caught up in finding what is easier or cheaper but finding what is morally right thing to do. Companies when hiring programmers might look at Indian programmers and see a cheaper and less demanding route, but they need to stop and ask themselves if what they’re doing is in the best interest for themselves or the employees that they are hiring. American workers are custom to certain pay and regulations that sometimes companies don’t even consider how different it may be outsourcing to India. At the end of the day were all human beings with the same goal in life and we shouldn’t hold one group of individuals to a set of higher standards based on their ethnicity, gender or social background. I don’t think there is a right or wrong answer on which way to hire, but either way you go there are ethical questions that get brought up.",References,1188

September 14, 2020","How quickly computers went from being machines that were capable of only simple calculations and filled entire rooms. To, where they are now with the ability to fit in our pockets and calculate our location. It’s astonishing and given how fast technology has progressed, society still has quite a bit of catching up to do. In order to do so we must take a look at the ethical implications rather than the economic implications of computing. The topic to be discussed and analyzed are the ethical implications of offshore hiring within the computer industry. We will examine and determine a possible standard by using John Rawls idea of the “veil of ignorance [1].” Through Rawls’ approach we can apply the ideologies of Deontological ethics as well as Negative and Positive Rights to formulate a conclusion as to how to navigate the situation of hiring offshore.
To understand why ethics in the computer industry is so important we need to look at far technology has come. Over the past few centuries humans have developed new technologies such as the light bulb, telegraph, and automobiles that have had tremendous effects on society. To quantify the totality of these effects would be impossible. However, many would agree that technologies such as the aforementioned have had large impacts on society. We can observe the effects on society just by knowing someone who uses a car to travel and interact with other parts of society. In terms of Smartphones users, many now carry a large part of their identity inside their phone. Bank Accounts, photos, emails, credit card information, location are just some of the sensitive information held within the modern smartphone. With all of this valuable information held on a single device it’s clear that if the wrong individual were to have access a significant amount of damage could be done. The risks associated with personal data is just one of a multitude of issues that need to be addressed surrounding the ethics in the computer industry. With the rate at which technology is advancing we need to create an informed strategy of how to move forward with technological advances. Within a global society this strategy needs to be based on the ethical impacts of future implementations. By taking the approach we believe to the best of our knowledge to benefit both current and future generations is to do our part to create a balance in overall well-being for generations to come. Economic gain with the all too common narrative of driving the bottom line has become a dated model that hinders positive progress. To neglect the importance of ethics in the industry would surely spell disaster with the possibility of robots taking over not sounding as far fetched as it once was.
John Rawls approach of stripping back preconceived notions of self to examine issues through an unbiased lens is how we are going to try and find a solution to the dilemma of offshore hiring. Rawls’ idea was to remove “gender, age, race, talents, wealth, and so on in the real world [2],” it is then our responsibility to make informed decisions around “...protecting the most vulnerable and least advantaged members of society [3].” To better understand the implications of our decisions a fictional scenario can be created. In this scenario there’s a scientist that has figured out a way to download their consciousness into a computer. The computer has the ability to communicate to the scientist and answer questions. After questioning the computer the scientist realizes that they’ve created what they think to be the perfect technology for applying Rawls “veil of ignorance.” Without a body the scientist  finds the computer is free from societal implications that affect the ego and is able to compute outcomes that have the overall greatest positive impact.
Let’s suppose we are the computer and we’re in the room with the scientist that created us. The scientist has chosen to start exploring the offshore hiring dilemma by asking us, the computer, to apply Deontological ethics to it. As the computer you run a search on the definition and find that Deontological ethics are, “ theories that place special emphasis on the relationship between duty and the  of human actions [4].” When it comes to applying this definition to the business owner the argument could be made that because they are from the United States, it is their duty to hire from the United States. By hiring from their own country jobs are created locally which will allow for their employees and their families to have fulfilling lives. What if the business owner was originally from India though? Would their duty be to the country they were born in? So as the computer you are going to assume the business owner is from the U.S. because that is where their business is. Now let’s take into consideration what would happen if the scope of our duty became the entire human population. This new scope of duty may suggest that hiring from both India and the U.S. would be the optimal solution that has the ability to benefit two regions. This may seem like the best option so far until you take into consideration that hiring employees in the U.S. could lead to construction of more office buildings thus negatively affecting a large animal population negatively. So what if the scope of duty was to be expanded to the planet? Then it’d be fair to say that hiring completely from India would be the best solution. As we are still a single planet society it is reasonable to assume expanding the scope to the entire planet is currently the largest. So if this is the largest scope of duty that impacts the greatest number positively then by hiring from a point of view that is best for the entire planet makes the most sense.
Now let’s suppose the scientist wants to examine the dilemma by applying Negative and Positive Rights. “The reason for using these labels is that in the first case liberty seems to be a mere absence of something … whereas in the second case it seems to require the presence of something. [5]” According to Negative Rights it’s the natural liberty of the business owner to choose based upon what is the most advantageous for them. This means that the business owner could choose the option that while having numerous positive effects for them is extremely detrimental for another larger population. This is a limited scope and that can greatly limit overall net positive results. The fact that the business owner is having this dilemma we can assume they are looking through a larger scope. Positive Rights on the opposite side of the spectrum says to choose the outcome that helps the less fortunate. In this case hiring Indian workers would most likely benefit the less fortunate as it is still a developing country. Creating jobs in India could create a higher quality of life for the society allowing them more free time which may lead to a society able to give back more.
Even when evaluating the offshore dilemma through the eyes of a computer that has no attachment to the outside world it is clear to see it’s still difficult to come to a definitive answer. Many people when making decisions limit their scope of the problem and can quickly come to a conclusion that may ultimately have larger negative impacts. The difficulty of living in a global society is accounting for everything within the system. A delicate balance has been in place for longer than we can comprehend. We are now at a point in civilization that we may be the cause of tipping this balance due to our ignorance. After examining the above results, companies could look to change their hiring practices and make their decisions viewed through the appropriate scope. There are no cut and dry solutions, we have to work to cover as many bases as we possibly know how.
In conclusion, it is clear that the greatest good comes from a duty to this planet. We have made incredible advances in computing capabilities, however, we cannot forget our roots. Without the planet there would be no us. It’s our duty as a human race to move forward in becoming a proactive and sustainable society.","Bibliography:

9/15/2020","As billions of computers flood the homes and businesses of people around the globe, it is more important than ever to understand the importance of ethics. With this ability to work and communicate through computers, businesses have new ethical territory to make sense of. The ethics of computing will determine how people across borders, religions, and governments interact with each other, as well as define what is equality and justice in the borderless, digital world. In this paper I will determine the ethics surrounding a hypothetical business which is determining whether to hire U.S. programmers, or Indian programmers at a lower salary. I will use this paper to analyze the problem from the perspective of the U.S. worker, and from the Indian worker using both American philosopher John Rawls’ Difference Principle and Utilitarian ethics.
In John Rawls book A Theory of Justice Rawls describes a method of creating Principles that are “fair” and not motivated by our own sex, race, religious beliefs, social class, etc. Rawls defines this process as putting the decision maker(s) behind “the Veil of Ignorance”[1]. The Veil of Ignorance ensures that the decisions being made are in the best interest for all people that are governed by the decision maker. Rawls goes on to describe how these decisions should affect the people who follow these decisions. There are multiple principles of Justice that are described by Rawls but the one that will be used in this paper is called “the Difference Principle” and is defined by the following,
Social and economic inequalities should be arranged so that they are both (a) to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged persons, and (b) attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions of equality of opportunity. [1]
The other theory that will be used to evaluate these different decisions is Utilitarianism. Utilitarianism is an ethical theory that determines right from wrong by focusing on outcomes. Utilitarianism holds that the most ethical choice is the one that will produce the greatest good for the greatest number [4]. Both the Difference Principle and Utilitarianism will now be applied to the different groups of people affected by the company’s hiring decision to determine if the company is violating Rawls’ principles of justice and/or providing the greatest good to the largest number of people.
In 2019 the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that the number of Software Developer jobs available in the U.S. was approximately 1,469,200. This fact shows that there is a healthy pool of work available for U.S. software developers. In addition to the abundance of work available for U.S. Software Developers, there is also the inherent advantage of being in the U.S. which has laws in place that protect workers. These laws ensure that there are sufficient working conditions available at a company, includes air conditioning, meal breaks, and suitable chairs/desks. The U.S. also provides advantages outside of work. There are programs to help individuals who are out of work so that they can still eat and provide for their family.
In India it is very lucrative to become a Software Developer. Due to the higher pay an Indian developer can significantly improve their current quality of living if they can secure a Software Development job. Since the job in question is remote, the Indian worker will have to continue working from India, which means that they will have to be able to find a place with reliable internet connection. This could result in the Indian worker having to work from an office that does not supply proper working conditions. The office could be hot, cramped, and poorly maintained, that is if it is maintained at all. These conditions are only applicable if the Indian worker can secure the job in the first place. Without the job, the Indian worker will have to rely on the government for support, which is only provided to the workers who have contributed for at least three years [3].
When the company hires the U.S. worker, they are paying full price for the work. This eats into the profits of the company. Now that the product is being developed in the United States the company could declare that its entire operation is maintained in the U.S., which can then be used to advertised for more domestic customers. Since there is a sense of pride using something that originates from your country, we can consider this good for the company and its customers. Finally, providing a job to the U.S. worker ensures that the new employee will have suitable work conditions for his employment. The Utilitarian view of this scenario shows minimal benefit to the majority of people. The only substantial benefit goes to the portion of customers and business leaders who care about the product being made in the U.S. The last portion of benefit comes from the U.S. worker who is simply happy to have secured the job. This decision would actually violate Rawls’ Difference Principle since the least advantaged, Indian workers, would be left without a job and no opportunity to provide for their families resulting in the worker relying on a Welfare system that is less substantial than that of the U.S.
When the company hires the Indian workers there is an immediate gain provided to the entirety of the customer base. Since the work required for the product is being acquired at a lower cost the company can lower the price of the product without sacrificing the quality of the product. When the business employs the Indian worker they are giving the Indian worker the opportunity to increase their current standard of living, resulting in their family and themselves benefiting from better surroundings. They can then push their excess spending money into the local economy resulting in the flourishing of the surrounding community. Since the U.S. worker is not getting the job, they must either find work elsewhere or fallback on the Welfare system in the U.S. The Utilitarian analysis to this scenario is much greater than the one mentioned previously. Since the product is offered at a lower price the entirety of the consumer base benefits from the savings on the product. With the newly acquired income, the Indian worker’s family benefits from the improvement in living conditions. There is also an addition to the money circulating the local economy that adds to the Utilitarian benefit of the decision. The only negative comes from the U.S. worker who now has to find work, however, in comparison to the condition the Indian worker would have been if he did not secure the job, the Utilitarian loss is marginal. This decision is also in agreeance to Rawls’ Difference Principle since the least advantaged party (Indian Worker) is left in a better position than they were if the decision was not made.
In retrospect I am amazed by how these simple tools can help inform someone about the ethics surrounding a decision. Before completing my research, I was sure that it was most ethical to hire U.S. workers. Now, I believe the ideas of Utilitarianism and the Difference Principal make it clear how that decision doesn’t provide the greatest benefit to most people, and to those least advantaged. I believe any business can follow my example and use these methods to conduct their own business decisions. They simply have to determine the conditions of those affected and evaluate the impact each possible outcome will have those different populations.
In conclusion, there are heavy implications for any business decision. It is important that a company makes these decisions only after they consider the ethical consequences these decisions. Following Utilitarian ethics and Rawls’ Difference Principle it is easy to evaluate the ethics involved with a business decision, and for any future decision a business is going to make.","References

Societal and Ethical Implications of Computing
September 14, 2020","According to the dictionary, ethics are defined as “a structure of standards and practices that influence how people lead their lives.” Obviously, ethics are not required to be followed, but ethics create an understanding in society about what is morally considered right and what is wrong. Ethics does not only pertain to the rights and wrongs of society, but also serves as an importance to many of the industries that revolve around this world, for example: computing. Computer ethics are to be considered moral standards that set boundaries for the use of computers. Common issues of computer ethics consist of issues with privacy, intellectual rights, and the effects on society. Computer ethics is something that is rarely touched upon when mentioning ethics. The lack of concern for computer ethics is a mistake and the importance of ethics for the industry of computing is underrated.
Some of the common issues within computer ethics were stated as issues related to privacy, intellectual rights, and the effects on society. When speaking about issues related to privacy, things that come to mind are hacking, malware, data protection, and anonymity. The internet is constantly being used and a lot of these users are unaware of these issues that happen in front of their eyes. Hacking is an illegal intrusion into other users’ computer/network. A hacker can enter a different system/network through security and can acquire unlawful access to somebody else’s computer. Malware is short for malicious software. Malicious software consists of computer viruses, spyware, and worms. These are all types of computer programs that replicate. When the program successfully replicates and inserts its code into other computers, the affected areas of the computer software is “infected.” Data protection is the process of protecting data which then creates a relationship between individual privacy rights while still allowing certain data to be used for business purposes. Anonymity is a way to keep a user private when using navigating through the internet. Many people would argue these computer issues are unethical because they all have to do with the invasion of privacy. Often when a person is hacking, it is done to break into a network/system to steal information or money or to insert a virus on ones’ computer. Relating this back to society and ethics, would it be ethical for a robber to break into the home of somebody and steal certain information or money? In terms of anonymity, the owner of the house that is soon to be robbed is standing at the front door with a bulletproof vest and a shotgun. The owner in the front can be considered a VPN for the computer. This masks the user and he is untraceable from the hackers online. This is the same exact thing except in terms of computing. I would consider both scenarios unethical because it is illegal, and it is harmful to either the owner of the house or the owner of the computer. The effects computing has on society is as followed: Jobs, environmental impact, and social impact. Humans go to school to get a degree to soon obtain a job that they are best qualified for. As technology improves, humans begin to lose their jobs to artificial intelligence. Some jobs have been completely taken over by computerized intelligence and some jobs have become simpler due to the assistance from the technology in these computers. “Things can now be done in just one click whereas before it takes multiple steps to perform one task3.” Some may think this is ethical because it is making the work area much simpler, but this is in fact unethical because this does not allow employees to practice their skills. This eliminates multiple jobs around the world and increases unemployment. There are many factors to this that are most definitely debatable. The social impact is very important as the internet/computers are the main ways humans interact with one another. Social media is very popular, and this is the simplest, easiest way to communicate. The usage of computers and gaming is very ethical in the way that “hand eye coordination is practiced, stress relief, and improved strategic thinking”  but could also yield negative/unethical point of views: “addiction in gamers, isolation from the real world and exposure to violence3.” At the same time, the usage of computers affects the environment because the increase in computer usage yields an increase in the emission of greenhouse gases. This is unethical to the environment because it is a form of pollution and in society, polluting is unethical. These reasons are crucial for the importance of ethics for the industry of computing because the world is slowly revolving around computers/technology and this is something we will live with for the rest of our lives so why not realize the ethics and the importance of computing.
According to section 1.4.2 of the textbook1, Social Contracts and a Theory of Political Justice states that Rawl believes that “an action, or a social or political structure is not ethical if it has the effect of leaving the least-advantaged people worse than they were before1.” This means whatever action someone commits cannot treat “least-advantaged people” worse than where they started from or he considers it unethical. Rawl is in favor of the less fortunate and would like for them to not have worse lives. A tool that he uses to keep this in check is the “veil of ignorance1.” This tool considers ethical and social issues and behind this veil, “we choose policies that would be fair for all,” which indicates that the least-advantaged people would always be protected under any circumstance. In this excerpt written by Robert Cavalier from Carnegie Mellon and Charles Ess, Drury college, Cavalier defines Rawl’s theory of justice as a guarantee in a morally acceptable society2. This idea entertains the scenario of whether to hire U.S. programmers or Indian programmers. In Rawl’s “veil of ignorance,” the correct answer would be to hire Indian programmers over U.S. programmers because this ensures a better career for the Indian people whereas that would be an extra boost for the average U.S. worker because Indian people usually live in more poverty than the U.S. Before the analysis, I completely agreed with Rawl’s theory because we live life for granted and there are so many other people that wish to live the way we do here in the US. This is easily tied into the three computer ethics issues we have in this world today. If Raw’s theory was applied in these situations, there would always be a positive outcome. For example, if the theory were applied to the issues with jobs and artificial intelligence, Rawl would argue that the least-advantaged people would continue to work even though there are computers/technology that could replace them easily. This idea is very ethical and serves justice in this society, both computing and society in general.
Rawl’s theory is very convincing in the way that ethics is not a subject a lot of people disregard and believe that it does not affect themselves or others’ lives. This indeed changes a bunch of perspectives I had with not only social ethics, but with ethics in computing. I still stand by the idea that the lack of concern for ethics in computing is a mistake and the importance of ethics for the industry of computing is underrated because if more people were involved with the ethics of computing, there would not be as many mishaps as there are going on in the realms of the internet. Many people could learn this stuff and help the problems stated throughout computing. One day, all users will be able to log onto their computers without fear.","References

Hiring foreign workers can be an ethical issue for any industry. While the labor is cheaper, there are consequences for companies, immigrants, and natural-born citizens that come with saving money by hiring immigrants and paying them less. In the computing industry, a common practice is to hire Indian programmers rather than U.S. programmers because they will take less money. In this paper I will discuss the ethical implications of policies that regard hiring foreign workers and assess them using John Rawls’ ideas about social contracts and justice.
Failing to consider ethics in the computing industry could have drastic consequences on the innovative society we live in. With more and more scenarios where computers are responsible for morally debatable decisions in our technologically driven world, we need a concrete system of incorporating ethics into computers and technology in general.  Not only are people in the computing industry responsible for implementing ethics into their programming and computers, but they are also responsible for doing so in the human side of the industry as well. Here I will discuss the ethical issue of hiring Indian programmers rather than U.S. programmers to save salary expenses. The specific scenario is as follows:
“You are a manager at a software company about to begin a large software project. You will need to hire dozens of programmers. Using the Internet for communication and software delivery, you can hire programmers in another country at a lower salary than programmers in your country. Should you do this?” [1]
Baase and Henry analyze this question using a utilitarian approach and a deontological approach. Analyzing it by assigning a utility value for U.S. programmers vs Indian programmers and you find yourself in an issue of deciding how to define the utility in the first place. The authors also conclude that “the hiring decision does not obviously treat the potential programmers of the two countries differently in a way that has to do with ends and means” [1]. However I believe the authors failed to consider this being a valid assessment of the situation, or put more clearly, I believe that the decision to hire programmers in one country versus the other will likely treat the programmers as a means to an end, with the ‘end’ being saving money on hiring employees. Approach the problem using Kant’s method and one might ask “How would I like a world where ALL companies hired foreign workers for their lower wages rather than national workers?”. In general, one might agree that if this is the maxim that we identify for this problem, then most people would not follow it. So, does that mean that we have answered the question? Not necessarily. If the general rule not being followed is to hire foreign workers for their cheaper labor, then what IS the rule being followed? If the rule is to hire national workers as to not neglect the national economy and workforce, then would not it still neglect the workforce of the foreign countries who rely on United States industry for hiring? Therefore, the deontological approach fails to assess this problem as well.
John Rawls employs the ancient ideas of social contract into his works for political justice. The foundation of his ethical guidelines is “consistent with an emphasis on liberties (negative rights). Rawls distinguishes his system of justice by adding a strong requirement for claim rights (positive rights)” [2]. Rawls enforces his ideas with a list of eight principals that order the international basic structure:
Peoples are free and independent, and their freedom and independence are to be respected by other peoples.
Peoples are to observe treaties and undertakings.
Peoples are equal and are parties to the agreements that bind them.
Peoples are to observe the duty of nonintervention (except to address grave violations of human rights).
Peoples have a right of self-defense, but no right to instigate war for reasons other than self-defense.
Peoples are to honor human rights.
Peoples are to observe certain specified restrictions in the conduct of war.
Peoples have a duty to assist other peoples living under unfavorable conditions that prevent their having a just or decent political and social regime. [3]
Employing John Rawls’ ideas to this problem and one would find that a decision that leaves least-advantaged people worse than before the decision would be unethical. How does one define which group of potential employees is least advantaged? This one seems straightforward; Indian programmers are more reliant on being hired due to more competition in the industry and this is obviously shown in the fact that they will take less payment for the same job. Thinking about the problem through Rawls’ lens and it seems like the ethical decision is to hire the Indian programmers. What might be some problems with Rawls’ approach? Rawls considers a society where there are people that might be living under an unfavorable position based on some unjust aspect of that society inherently. Criticisms for Rawls’ ideas press on this topic because it may not be a universal concept but only applicable for a specific society with existing intolerance. Howard Chang states in his paper on “The Immigration Paradox: Poverty, Distributive Justice, and Liberal Egalitarianism
”by excluding aliens from our labor market and our society, we can avoid the obligations that we would incur by admitting them. Rawls assumes that the "" boundaries of his principles ""are given by the notion of a self-contained national community. ""Similarly, Woodward argues in favor of applying Rawls's framework to ""inhabitants of a particular country"" and rejects the suggestion that Rawls's principles of justice apply globally."" [4].
So, while Rawls’ approach has its flaws, since we are applying it to a specific nation rather than a global society, it is more acceptable to his methods.
After considering the different ethical approaches of this problem I would also like to mention my own initial opinions on the topic. While hiring the U.S. workers over Indian workers may leave the less advantaged group further behind, it also does not perpetuate the problem as hiring them would. Continuing to hire them for lesser wages will only insist a feedback loop on the gap in wages between the two countries. On the one hand the Indian programmers are getting hired, but on the other hand it only makes it clear to U.S. computing industries that Indians are ok with being payed less. It is also important to mention the value of hiring more local workers to stimulate local economy, and this effect on the national level. Neglecting the workforce of a country due to the economy of another will likely influence both countries negatively rather than positively. Ultimately, I believe that the utilitarian approach is valuable if you assign the utility of each group as how well it would affect the macroeconomies of both countries if all U.S. industries made the same decision. In this case, hiring U.S. workers would be the more ethical option.","References

1","Similar to legal, medical and accounting ethics, computing industry has its own ethic too. Ethics is the study of what it means to “do the right thing”[1]. In “A Gift of Fire”, the author referred ethical rules are the rules that people follow when they interact with the others, it apply to everyone and are intended to enhance human dignity, peace, happiness and well-being for people in general [1]. Starting from the rapid developments in computing industry, the arise of internet, social networking, e-commerce and artificial intelligence, the ethics for the industry of computing need to be emphasized. Privacy or safety issues, law and principles of intellectual property and internet crime, all these problems need to be addressed with laws and ethics.
There are plenty of theories that can be applied to establish a firm justification for the rules and decide if it is ethical to do so: deontological, utilitarianism (consequentialism), natural rights, negative and positive rights and more ethical theories help in making ethical choices.  But there is no absolute right or wrong when making this choice, a choice that chose by majority of people does not mean it is an ethical choice as well. In this scenario about whether to hire U.S. programmers or Indian programmers, the impact of offshoring and ethical issues will be discussed.
John Rawl, a political philosopher of twentieth century, wrote a book named A Theory of Justice [TJ] in 1971, introduced some new theories in moral and political aspects. His concepts were opposed with the utilitarianism, Rawls has no universal principle: “The correct regulative principle for anything,” he says, “depends on the nature of that thing” [2]. He has different views in defining legitimacy and stability and justice within a liberal society.  His concepts were greatly influenced by Immanuel Kant, a philosopher in 17th century who claimed that “always treat persons (including yourself) an end in themselves, never merely as a means to your own ends” [3]. One of Rawl’s concept, the veil of ignorance will be discussed and applied in the scenario. The veil of ignorance stated that a citizen is of a certain race, class, and gender is no reason for social institutions to favor or disfavor her [4]. Behind the veil of ignorance, the parties that represent real citizens have no idea with the person’s race, ethnicity, gender, age, income, or wealth. They only know the general faces and common sense about human social life. After the veil of ignorance is removed, the parties cannot make changes with their final agreement.
In the scenario of whether to hire U.S. programmers or Indian programmers, the concept above can provide a fair and clear view compared with utilitarianism. When we talked about offshoring, most of the time was because the companies wanted to minimize the cost of labor so they can maximize their profit. But many people advocated that it is unethical to offshore the business to other countries just because they can pay the foreign workers with lower salary. With utilitarianism theory - “greater happiness for greater people”, hiring Indian programmers will be a better choice for the company and the worker in Indian without any doubt. If we apply veil of ignorance in this issue, and treat all the programmers as their own ends, regardless their race and nationality, it doesn’t really matter which side we choose. We should treat them all in the same way. If we see them as a means to an end, then the hiring decision will definitely be unfair for both side, Indian programmers’ will be exploited by
lower wages, and American programmers will lose some good opportunities just because they cost more.
Before I learned about Rawl’s theories, I believed that utilitarianism will be the best way to solve this problem. Because this makes the company, the Indian programmers and the customers happy. But after I studied his theories, I realized that this might be an unethical choice Utilitarianism might be the best theory to apply from the aspect of financial. But if we choose Indian programmers just because of the cost of labor, that will sound unethical. As the textbook states, “your decision affects other people besides the programmers: your customers, the owners or stockholders of your company, and, indirectly, many people in other businesses”, therefore the company should choose the programmers according to their business conditions, but not the nationality itself [1].
Although ethical theories do not completely settle difficult, controversial issues, they help to identify important principles or guidelines. They remind us of things to consider, and they can help clarify reasoning and values.[1] Human behavior and real human situations are far more complex than what we could think of, trade-off usually will be considered to solve the ethical problems. Company can use the profit that saved from labor cost in providing a better working environment for the workers, some laws can be enforced to make sure the same salary will be paid to all the employees regardless their working location. As the globalization keep going on, offshoring will become more common, thus it is important to address this ethical problem so that when offshoring opportunities arise in other developing countries, American firms will be able to benefit will minimizing the potential harms.[5]","References

September 9, 2020","The world of computing can bring several occasional state of affairs that’ll require computing professionals to act and make decisions regarding the code of ethical conduct. There are also ethical issues that are present in the computing society, some of which are computer crime, responsibility for computer failure, protection of computer property, records, and software, and privacy of the company, workers, and customers. It is essentially salient that the computing industry incorporates ethics into its decision-making processes and upon employees and developers. The presence of ethics in today's computing industry can aid in settlements or decisions that can cause possible drastic change to a company or industry. For instance, Berzai, the author of the article, “Ethical Problems in Computing” states, “Because of its constantly changing nature, the area of computer technology is one that is difficult to assign a specific set of moral codes, although it is necessary that ethics be considered when making decisions in this area. Computing creates a whole new set of ethical problems, unique unto itself.” The author declares the importance of ethics in computing as it can be a difficult process to endeavor. The concept of moral codes plays a part in numerous executive decisions. For example, in most cases, it is morally wrong to commit a computer crime; a crime such as stealing or transferring funds from a computer. The act itself goes against several moral codes, and it negatively impacts the person whose funds were stolen.
Privacy is one of the most important concepts in computing as it can be breached, obtained, and used unethically. “A great deal of the concern has to do with the amount of information gathering that is made possible by computers. This puts people’s personal information in a vulnerable position. If someone hacks into a computer system, all this information is at his/her disposal. In this way, such crimes as identity theft can occur” (Berzai). This statement exemplifies why ethics should be present in the computing industry, as it states how one’s private and concealed information can be easily obtained and misused. The presence of moral ethics should be with the person or professional that has access to one’s private information, as they can easily misapply this with things that may not be morally just or right.
An idea that can be utilized when making ethically moral decisions in computing, is the idea of John Rawls. The social contract is an agreement among the members of a society to cooperate for social benefits, for instance by sacrificing some individual freedom for state protection. The modern philosopher, John Rawls, took the social contract theory further, as he developed provisions of the contract based on how he viewed justice as fairness. The establishment of principles for proper political power in a society with people of different religions, viewpoints and lifestyles, was at the top of Rawls’ agenda. He believed that reasonable people, recognizing that a legal structure is necessary for social order, will eventually want to cooperate on terms that’ll be accepted by all, and they will abide by the rules of society, including the ones that they do not agree with. Rawls’ foundation is consistent with an emphasis on liberties, otherwise known as negative rights. He distinguishes his idea of system of justice by adding a strong requirement for claim rights, otherwise known as positive rights, which is a just and fair political system that’ll ensure that all citizens have sufficient means to make effective use of their freedoms.
An analysis that can be applied to these concepts and ideas is the “Ethics of Hiring Foreign Workers.” The use of offshoring, which is the practice of basing some of a company’s processes or services overseas, so as to take advantage of lower costs, is very controversial as it brings along questions regarding the economics and ethics of it. The scenario that is used in the book states, “You are a manager at a software company about to begin a large software project. You will need to hire dozens of programmers. Using the Internet for communication and software delivery, you can hire programmers in another country at a lower salary than programmers in your country” (Baase). This scenario poses a lot of ethically moral questions that can be viewed in many ways. For instance, if this was viewed in the perspective of utilitarianism, the correct decision would be the one that benefits the majority. In this case, the manager is choosing between the U.S and Indian programmers, as the selection of the U.S. programmers will result in them being paid more dollars, thus leaving the Indian programmers without the job. On the other hand, the selection of the Indian programmers will result in leaving the U.S. programmers without the job because of the lower salary that the Indian programmers will be receiving, which in a sense seems morally wrong.
Using Rawls’ idea in this scenario will result in the Indian programmers receiving the job. To elaborate, “In Rawls’ view, an action or social or political structure is not ethical if it has the effect of leaving the least-advantaged people worse than they were before” (Baase). Under those circumstances, choosing the U.S. developers over the Indian developers would be morally wrong because it’ll leave the Indians worse than they were before. This can be justified with the statement by Baase in the “Ethics of Hiring Foreign Workers” which says, “First, suppose your company is doing something to limit the other options of the Indian programmers. If your company is lobbying for U.S. import restrictions on software that Indian firms produce, for example, thus decreasing the availability of the other programming jobs in India, then you are manipulating the programmers into a situation where they have few or no other choices. In that case, you are not respecting their freedom and allowing them to compete fairly.” Moreover, it is assumed that the treatment of the Indian programmers as ends in themselves also includes the respect of their choices, in particular for offering to work for lower wages than U.S. programmers to better their lives. So, in the point of view of Rawls’ idea, denying the Indian programmers the job will result in being unethical and morally wrong because it will be leaving the “least-advantaged” people worse than they were before.
Overall, the presence of ethics in the industry of computing is important as it gives computing professionals a sort of “second thought” while they make essential moral decisions. The ideas of Kant and utilitarianism were utilized to analyze situations and scenarios that required moral and ethical thinking so that the outcome would be surely beneficial and correct. Lastly, the ideas of Rawls were used to determinate and distinguish economic advantage from ethical arguments.","Works Cited

Ethical Analysis on Offshoring in Programming","When considering any business decision in the computing industry, it is important to make careful ethical analysis. In such an instance, it may or may not be considered ethical for a U.S. company to hire Indian programmers for a lower salary than U.S. programmers. Diligent ethics analysis is important for the success and credibility for any company in computing.
Ethics holds a significant and defining role in the industry of computing. As technology advances further into a standard of automation, smaller and more portable devices, and beyond, the interaction between humans will experience major shifts. I believe it is important to apply ethical analysis to retain a sense of humanity amidst the rapid growth in technology. Similarly, the evolution of modern technology advances a society into an unknown territory; one which presents complex situations not yet experienced. Those involved with computing must be able to apply ethics to the best of their ability so a society can be maintained through the evolution of technology.
In [2], Baase introduces an ethical discussion in which a United States software company, in need of many programmers for a large project and given the ability to work remotely, must make a decision whether to hire U.S. programmers or Indian programmers, who can be paid less.  There are many different views on this subject, but many of which can be reduced to a question of whether the decision would have a greater impact on Indian programmers, or their U.S. counterparts. One view suggests that, while there is no utility placed on nationality, there may be some utility placed on the cost of salary [2]. Another point argues that hiring Indian programmers for the benefit of a lower pay is unethical as it treats them as means, and without respect [2]. On the other hand, Baase suggests it is also unethical to not be willing to hire Indian programmers based on their salary as it disrespects the choices made by the Indian programmers [2]. Another point considered is the low quality of work environment possibly endured by the Indian programmers [2], and that hiring them could have both a chance at improvement with a company salary or benefits as well as moral implications since such working conditions are much worse than those experienced by U.S. programmers. These views introduced by Baase are some of many and provide several aspects to examinate in an ethical analysis of this scenario.
The work of philosopher John Rawls can be applied to expand on the [2] utilitarianist approach to this scenario. In his book, A Theory of Justice, Rawls developed ideas on social order and institutions, with an emphasis on how those institutions must balance a fair structure through assigned rights and duties such that its members can act freely [3]. These ideas are aligned with claim rights (positive rights) and liberties (negative rights), where the individual must submit to the rules of a society but can maintain their freedoms, respectively [1]. One of Rawls’s more infamous ideas is the Difference Principle, which holds that social and economic inequalities should exist in a society only if they provide the most amount of benefit to the least-advantaged people [3], although many variables in this principle are left undefined. Rawls also introduced a “veil of ignorance,” a filter behind which a person has no concept of unique identity, allowing that person to make fair and ethical decisions regarding life in a society, uninfluenced by social and economic factors [4]. These ideas from Rawls create a concept of ethical behavior within a society and its institutions and can be used to further analyze the programming scenario.
First, I will analyze the suggestion that if the company hires the Indian programmers because they are paid less than the U.S. programmers, it would be unethical. Rawls’s concept of a society is based heavily on its institutions and governance, and how the rules of a society must be fair but must also apply to all members. In this case, it can be said that the United States and India are separate societies with respective governments. As the company is based in the United States, it is not subject to the social rules of India and is not responsible for the wages for Indian programmers. For this case, it could be considered ethical to hire Indian programmers for a lower wage.
Rawls’s work can also be applied to the suggestion that hiring Indian programmers could empower the group and benefit the company or cause moral implications from the working conditions. Suppose the company hired the Indian programmers and offered a pay raise. This is an example of the Difference Principle; the company chooses to offshore labor which has an effect on its community, but the Indian programmers, which are lesser-advantaged, receive work and a pay raise that can benefit their lives and communities. If, in this example, the company were to pay the same salary to either group, what would be the motivation to hire the Indian programmers over the U.S. programmers? As [2] suggests, there may be some moral motivators such as humanity or generosity. Thus, it can be said that this moral motivation can serve as a type of societal institution as discussed by Rawls, an informal set of ethical standards which might encourage this company to hire Indian programmers at a higher salary to improve the programmers’ standard of living. This also adheres to the veil of ignorance, as the company removes societal identifiers and recognizes the social and labor inequality given to Indian programmers. It should be noted, however, that the potential impact of offshoring for the company and its community is difficult to estimate.
In the first analysis on hiring Indian programmers for their lower salary, my initial opinion was that not hiring U.S. programmers in favor of paying a lower salary was unethical, although I could understand why a company may decide to offshore their programmers in efforts to be cost-effective. After the analysis, I can understand the lack of obligation a company has to programmers from a different society, although my opinion stays the same due to personal ethical beliefs. This could be useful to small U.S. companies who struggle to pay the U.S. programmer salary because paying the Indian programmers’ salary may keep their businesses afloat on a small budget. For my second analysis of the benefit to hiring Indian programmers and paying a higher salary, I initially agreed with this point. I believed that while it is good for businesses to contribute to their communities and hire U.S. workers, the company has potential to improve the lives of the workers and communities in India for whom the benefit could be more significant. After the analysis, I maintain my initial opinion. This might be useful to a larger company in the U.S. who is looking to increase their societal impact and provide benefit to the Indian programmers.
Ethics is a vast subject with many approaches and schools of thought. The work of Rawls and Utilitarianism focus on the moral consequence of an action, such as a company choosing to hire the lower-salaried Indian programmers over U.S. programmers. Based on my application of these principles, I believe it is not necessarily unethical to hire Indian programmers over the U.S. group, and this action can provide great benefit to Indian communities. This demonstrates just one of the ways ethics plays a deliberate and necessary role in the computing industry.","References

Societal and Ethical Implications of Computing
15 September 2020","Many decisions in today’s computing industry can be seen as unethical and have potentially long-lasting consequences and impacts on society. The industry is cutthroat and a majority of companies look for any opportunity to get ahead of each other, such as hiring foreign programmers. This creates ethical dilemmas and renders the importance of ethics. Philosophers such as Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and John Rawls developed ideas surrounding societal ethics that could be analyzed and applied to this industry.
In 1651, Thomas Hobbes developed the idea of social contract theory in his book Leviathan. He believed that man is rational and will seek a better situation, even with the cost of giving up some independence as long as there was an authority to enforce this social contract [3]. This ideology paved the way for John Locke’s theory that people could enforce moral rules (life, liberty, and property) in a state of nature, however, it was optimal to leave the job to a government authority with an implicit social contract [3]. After Hobbes and Locke’s theories, a modern American philosopher named John Rawls took social contract theory and expanded upon it with his own developments based on his view of Justice as Fairness.
In John Rawl’s expanded social contract theory, he stated that reasonable people who recognize that a legal or political structure is necessary for social order, will abide by the rules of society even if they do not agree with all of them [1]. Further, he divided Justice as Fairness into two principles: the First Principle states that each person has the same claim to equal basic liberties. The Second Principle states that social and economic inequalities are to satisfy two conditions: fair equality of opportunity and the greatest benefit of the least-advantaged members of society [2]. Rawls’ system of justice can also be distinguished with negative rights and positive rights. Negative rights are the liberties that a person may possess and positive rights are the claim rights. An example of a negative right includes freedom from violence. A positive right would be starting a physical fight with someone who insulted you. John Rawls’ views can be applied in the ethical dilemmas in the computing industry. Specifically the ethical dilemma of hiring domestic programmers from the United States versus programmers from India.
Assume I am in charge of hiring ten programmers for a project at a company. My boss tells me that I can only hire people from the United States and India. First, let us analyze this without Rawls’ ethics. In the perspective of practicality, some major differences that would affect the hiring process (excluding economics and technicalities) would include timezone, racism, language barriers, and keeping jobs in the United States. Would it be ethical to only hire United States programmers due to their closer time zone and same native language? Is it racist to purposely not hire Indian programmers to give the money and job titles to fellow Americans only? Will one demographic be racist/prejudiced to the other during development? Will this make development more difficult? Depending on who you ask, there would be different answers. However, in my opinion, I do believe that answering no to these questions are ethical in terms of practicality. It’s correlation versus causation; it is more efficient to hire Americans than Indians, but not because of their nationality/culture.
However, instead of practicality, what if we looked from a progressive point of view? The world is as communicative and small as it has ever been. Should we be embracing this and hiring foreign programmers? Would this make the world a better place for disenfranchised nations if ethics stated that the solution was to hire them? From a progressive point of view, yes; the most ethical solution would be to hire all Indian programmers and be all-inclusive. In contrast, hiring only Indian programmers could be seen as virtue signalling and therefore extremely unethical. I believe hiring only Indian programmers is unethical in this situation.
We have analyzed this dilemma based on practicality and progressiveness, so let us expand. Leaving all economic and technical analysis aside again, we can use John Rawls’ ideologies to ethically analyze and come up with multiple solutions that are deemed ethical relative to his perspective of ideals. According to John Rawls’ Second Principle of Justice as Fairness, all people must have equal opportunities and the solution must possess the greatest benefit for the least-advantaged members [2]. However, since India and the United States fall under two or more different implicit “social contracts” enforced by their respective governments and societies, this can be interpreted in a few different ways.
If we look from the perspective of the world and assume a social contract for it, both citizens would fall under it. Both U.S. and Indian programmers would have to be seen as equals. However, in many cases they are not; India is 9 hours ahead of the American east coast. In terms of meetings, this will be difficult for both parties. Two solutions could be to hire all Americans and skip the time zone differences, or hire all Indian programmers and have only the project manager from the United States deal with the timezone discrepancy. If we analyze these two solutions with John Rawls’ ideals, the most ethical would be the latter solution. Due to the project lead most likely being the most advantaged (due to being in a higher position) and the Indian programmers being the least advantaged when compared to Americans in a majority of cases (living quality, education, internet speeds, etc), this would be the most ethical in terms of Rawls’ Principles.
Prior to reading these articles, I figured out my solutions based on practicality: what would benefit the project the most? After reading, however, I analyzed it with Thomas Hobbes’ and John Rawls’ ideologies regarding social contracts and Justice as Fairness. Even though my analysis of practicality was unethical in terms of Justice as Fairness, I believe there are more approaches that would be considered as more unethical. Personally, I do not agree with Justice as Fairness in this problem. Though, I do believe it can apply and work optimally in certain situations. Taking what I have learned now, if it were me in the hiring position and I worked at a small company with one location, I would choose my practicality approach. However, if I were a company such as Google or Amazon with a larger infrastructure across the globe, I would choose the Rawls’ Principles approach; however, I would build upon it with my own personal morals and ethics and hire a mix of United States and Indian programmers.","Bibliography

Computer Ethics","Ethics is an important value in everyday life. Ethics are the moral principles which one stands by to making decisions based on what is right and wrong. These moral principles affect the way people make decisions in their jobs and how they affect other people. An industry that is becoming very popular, Computing/Programming, can be greatly affected by one's morals in different ways. Ethics is very important in Computing, because technology is advancing at a fast rate giving everyone a chance to be connected through a device. These devices are programmed with dozens of applications for the use of the consumers. These consumers can be both a kid or an adult. Hence, why ethics is important, because society has become very reliant on these devices. It is important to always consider the safety and privacy of the consumer[4]. These decisions are held by the company who programmed the application. Another ethical decision these companies in the computing industry have to make are who they are willing to hire to get the job done. Projects for these companies can get done cheaper or with a high cost due to how much they got to pay the workers. This tends to be an option in a lot of companies as they can hire people with lower wages from another country to get the job done. These low wage workers can get the job done cheaper for the company, but they might not have the best working conditions to work with. A scenario that presents these issues is whether a company should hire U.S programmers with high wages or Indian programmers with low wages. This ethical decision can be taken using many concepts and one being Rawl’s idea.
A company is looking to hire workers to work on a program. They have the choice between hiring American programmers or Indian programmers. There are many ethical points of view that can influence the decision the company makes. Utilitarianism, which is the moral idea of making the decision based on having more good than bad as an outcome [1]. With utilitarianism you can make the decision of choosing Indian programmers to end up having to pay workers less and still achieve the program instead of paying high wage American workers. Using this reasoning for the decision can bring up many problems. It can be seen as exploitation since the company takes advantage of underpaying the workers[2]. It can also be limiting job opportunities to people in the other country. Another reason why hiring Indian programmers can be problematic is that the working conditions may be worse and it would look bad to put them through that situation[2]. Giving the Indian workers the job opportunity is a good thing, but having them to work in unethical situations may not help them progress for better conditions in their country. Also, it would be unethical to pay the Indian programmers less than the American programmers. Therefore, could cause a lower quality of product as the workers are unsatisfied with the pay. There are many views on making the right decision to this problem, but there has to be an ethical reasoning to support the decision.
A good way to determine a decision with ethics is using Rawls's idea. Rawl’s idea emphasizes on making decisions for the least fortunate so everyone can be treated fairly and have the same opportunities [3]. In other words, Rawl’s idea chooses to protect the vulnerable
first in any situation. Relating Rawl’s idea to the situation with the U.S. programmers and Indian programmers the Indian programmers would be the highest priority in the decision. Since stated early Indian programmers have worse job opportunities compared to the Americans. Although, he Indian programmers will be getting paid less it's only fair to give them the opportunity. American programmers are already getting paid a lot so the Indian programmers would need the money more than the Americans would. Furthermore, Indian programmers should get more support in this situation under the veil of ignorance. Using Rawl’s idea the Indian programmers should be favored to get the job opportunity.
Viewing the ethics behind the computing industry has caused many ideas and issues where some decisions may or may not be the right decisions. Out of all the ideas and concept Rawl’s idea seems to have the best ethical thinking. This implies, Indian programmers are the ones to get the job in the hiring situation. According to utilitarianism which was previously mentioned the decision is still the same, but the idea is different. With utilitarianism the benefit for the Indian programmers was left out. The benefits of the choice were more intended for the company to gain profit and exploitation. At first that seems like the reason as to why you would choose the Indian programmers first looking at the situation. Everything seemed to either affect the Indian programmers to be chosen. On the other hand, if the American programmers were chosen then there would be no negatives for workers, but there would be for the company as they lose more money. It would be a win-win situation for both the workers and the company if they chose Indian works using Rawl’s idea. The company will not only have to spend as much money they are giving Indian programmers to gain some sort of money as their conditions are not as good. This ethical idea of choosing to pick the option that favors the vulnerable is a really good ethical way of making decisions. This ideology can be used to solve many other problems companies have when it comes to their workers. If they ever have to make a decision on who needs the job the most they should consider the less fortunate first.
All in all, the best way to approach the company hiring situation and other problems is to ethically use Rawl’s idea. As stated before, there are moments where ethical decisions have to be made. These decisions can occur a lot in the computing industry as technology is advancing and there is a large source of workers to give job opportunities. Rawl’s idea was to emphasize the least fortunate in the situation. A problem that was addressed that used Rawl’s ideology was the company's decision between Indian and American workers. There were many ethical views on why one group should be chosen over the other one. Using utilitarianism, everything was going towards choosing the Indian programmers as the benefits were for the company was greater. Although this was the final decision Rawl’s idea ethically shows why they should be chosen with a better ethical view. The Indian programmers in this situation are the least unfortunate. They deserve the job more due to the low job opportunities they have and the chance of them getting paid even though it is less then what Americans make. Rawl’s ideology is a much better way to solve ethical issues as it looks for the greater positive impact of the situation to overshadow the negatives. This ethical concept can be used not only in the hiring situation, but in many other situations in the computing industry. The other concepts like utilitarianism can be alright, but using that ideology can be backed up by poor reasoning on the decision.","Electronic Documents

Societal and Ethical Implications of Computing
September 15 2020","When people think of computer science, ethics is not a topic that immediately comes to mind. However when it comes to ethics, mainly normative ethics, in the computing industry it is one of the most important topics a computer scientist can learn. In order to appreciate the effects ethics has in the computing world, we must imagine a situation in which evil corporations abuse the power of computer scientists and have them invent malicious technology that allows them to spy on people and tear down the notion of privacy. Without teaching the importance of ethics to computer scientists many would be more inclined to build software not for the reason of advancing technology and evolving human life but for other more insidious reasons. Here we will factor in philosopher John Rawls’ point of view and other ethical standpoints in an effort to try to answer the question: Should the U.S. hire foreign workers?
John Rawls is known for many ideas involving philosophy and was a provider of solutions to ethical and social conundrums. One of his more popular ideas was coining the term “veil of ignorance” when coming up with a way to describe a just political system [1]. What this term refers to is the concept of having each person wear a veil in which while wearing this veil, they are unbeknownst to anything that may be of value in the real world. Therefore the goal of this veil is to eliminate one's mind of any bias temptations that would otherwise pollute their decisions and present fair and equal policies for all. We will use this helpful tool to analyze the decision one would come to if wearing this veil. By not knowing anything about the programmers in the United States or in India, it all falls down to which is more qualified for the positions. Through the veil we are looking at many capable programmers with no obvious way to distinguish them besides their knowledge of computer science and work experience. To see which group would have the biggest advantage we would have to look at their education backgrounds and other relevant experiences in programming the type of software the company envisions. Other than this we can determine who to hire out of sheer convenience. It may be more convenient to hire programmers that reside in the United States due to transportation and whether or not they are fluent in English. On the other hand, if we were to base our reasoning on convenience alone it would cause chaos. For example, people would abandon others in times of crisis just because it was convenient for them to do so. Although the veil of ignorance may not allow us to be influenced by self desires, the veil does not account for acquired knowledge of economics [1]. Even while applying the veil of ignorance, it does not appear to give an absolute solution for deciding who to hire because it fails to eliminate the basic knowledge of humans along with a comprehension of the functions of the world.
Utilitarianism is a theory that allows for the most happiness in the greatest number of people. When applying this point of view to the problem we need to determine how to measure happiness and for how many people. Although it may be excessive, one could conclude that this would favor the Indians because they cost less leading to more room in the budget to potentially allow for more Indian programmers than U.S. programmers. Even if the company decided to only hire a fixed amount of programmers the company would have a larger budget for other things if they chose the utilitarian route (Indians) making them happier compared to if they had chosen the same amount of U.S. programmers. Assuming the happiness between each person is the same, this could be a feasible decision. With that being said, a feasible decision is not always the best decision to take. Taking this route, it would be difficult to calculate the extent to which happiness can spread and whether or not it is possible to tell what makes someone happy as opposed to other emotions and feelings. Logically speaking, wanting everyone happy is the ideal scenario but what if this decision makes one happy in the short term but then sad in the long term, then would it still count towards happiness? It is not very realistic to talk about eternal happiness but then that begs the question of how long does happiness have to last for it to count towards somebody being happy? Generally speaking, the answer is unknown because it is so objective and therefore utilitarianism fails to prove itself in this particular circumstance.
While the utilitarian perspective may hold some value, Rawls admits that he does not nearly like this approach more than his own as shown by his book, A Theory of Justice [4]. In his book he proposes “justice as fairness” [3] expressing that he believes all people as equals and that well - minded people would willingly abide by a hypothetical world where perfect equality exists. As such, Rawls would take a very egalitarian approach to whether or not we should hire programmers from a foreign country. If there were perfect equality, then through this lens we would choose both U.S. and Indian programmers. However, let us imagine that there is only enough budget for an odd number of programmers and that the amount each programmer gets paid is the same, thus equality. This situation would cause Rawls to favor having more foreign programmers to the team due to the fact that Rawls puts such a large emphasis on providing the “least advantaged people” [2] with the best care. He states, “Basic liberties cannot be infringed under any circumstances, even if doing so would increase the aggregate welfare, improve economic efficiency, or augment the income of the poor.” [3]. In other words, Rawls is stating that even if breaking a liberty causes an end to every country's financial problem, he would not and states must not take that trade. As seen by this, Rawls’ justice as fairness approach can only reach so far in terms of becoming somewhat more of an absolute solution.
Prior to my analysis of Rawls’ theories and interesting solutions, I would have chosen to go with the U.S. programmers. It was just instinct to me to go with the option I was more familiar with rather than take a risk by going with the foreign workers even if they may need the job more than the programmers in the United States. It would not be surprising for my decision to change if I had worn the veil of ignorance and considered just half of the factors that Rawls came up with. Rawls’ answers to this ethical dilemma was on and off. To be more specific, his answer would change whenever another one of his principles came into play and that made the question that much more interesting. Seeing as how Rawls viewed the situation in so many different points of views, it confirms how ethically valid the question is. Students could find my results helpful if they were presented this question or if they just wanted to look into different viewpoints on an issue. Similarly to me, they could have initially thought about the question in one way but may change their mind after taking into account Rawls’ egalitarian and liberal views on the topic.
Ultimately, my view on the question has not changed and I would still decide on the U.S. programmers. Rawls’ points were very convincing but unfortunately they weren’t enough to convince me although that may just be because of my stubbornness. The reasons for my decision, however, do differ from what I had initially thought. At first glance, it seemed like a simple budget scenario where the hiring manager is asked to spend the least amount of money for the same product. I failed to take into consideration other factors such as the implications of the question itself. The given situation implies that the company can afford either the U.S. programmers or the Indian programmers and is not requiring the answer to be one that supports the company. What I took from that is I could save some money by hiring the foreign workers or I could just spend the money that is already allocated to the hiring process and go the more reliable route. The only reason that really matters when considering hiring the foreign workers is not whether the company saves money or not but whether it is the company’s responsibility to hire them so that we could inspire other companies to do the same as a way of promoting global teamwork.","References

300Z","When I see the future of computing and what we, as responsible programmers, can do to promote ethical computing in society, I think to prioritize the safety of others and the overall improvement of the world, leaving a better and healthier world for the next people to inherit it. A world where we use technological developments for only the good of ourselves at the expense of the wealth of humanity is unethical. One example of this is the conflict between hiring Indian workers over US workers at a lower price than US workers. I personally believe in empowering the lower classes and giving them resources and tools to improve their circumstances, and as a result, improve our world overall. A world with a reduced wealth inequality gap, better environmental health, where everyone has the opportunity to get an education and not have to worry about dying of disease or starvation would be my vision for the future. This vision can only happen if we are responsible in computing, as unethical programming often put disadvantaged groups at a further disadvantage to those with that technology.
There are different views and ideas on what is ethical in computing. This discussion extends to outsourcing work to countries besides the US – often countries that have a large population of people in extreme poverty that will willingly work for less than their equally skilled US counterparts. Without considering race or nationality, these two groups start as equal in utility. The utility of the job for each group of programmers depends on how one evaluates the utility of the job for them. If you measure utility on the pure numerical value of how much money they receive, the US workers may be better hires. If you measure utility based on how much the potential hires might usually make as determined by the other members of their community, the Indian workers may be better hires (Bease, 334). Some people believe you are exploiting the Indian workers by paying them less, and cheating US workers out of a job they may have otherwise gotten. Some counter this point by saying that maybe the US workers are being paid too much, raising the price of products and thus affecting consumers negatively, and that there is nothing inherently unethical about choosing the cheaper of two products (Bease, 334). Another aspect of hiring Indian workers could be considered unethical if the conditions that they are working in are less desirable than the one that your US workers may work in. Other people argue that it is not their responsibility if an Indian worker must work in his own country, with its inherent flaws, and that they are giving Indian workers an opportunity to improve their lives and give money to their community (Bease, 335).
Rawls’ ideas of social contracts help us analyze this issue further. He posited that reasonable people will recognize reasonable laws as necessary and obey them if treated with fairness and respect. They will tolerate others and as such, promote free speech and will not impose their beliefs on others. A just system will ensure that all members of a society have access to freedom of speech (Bease, 38). Furthermore, Rawls also said that an action is unethical if disadvantaged people are left worse off than they were before the action was made. He places high utility on disadvantaged groups and far less utility on those that are already in positions of power. He does not elaborate on what makes someone a disadvantaged member of society, only that we should decide our action and policy based on the “veil of ignorance,” wherein all identifying characteristics such as race, gender, age, wealth and talents are hidden and we make policy based on the most-vulnerable members of society (Bease).
I believe that using Rawls’ idea of helping the disadvantaged members of society first, this causes some conflict against those that believe that it is not their responsibility to have good working conditions or pay Indian workers the same amount as US workers. It is common knowledge that Indian programmers are paid egregiously less than their US counterparts, work longer hours, and enjoy less benefits for equal work (Ahmed). There is even a term for this type of labor: code monkeys, and the irony is not lost that monkeys are often a derogatory euphemism for black and brown people in undeveloped, hot countries. Offshore employees are not treated as partners and equals, but rather as disposable robots to be abused and then discarded, often without a voice or any leverage to assert their needs in their exploitative environment. If we were to apply Rawls’ idea of fairness, Indians would be paid equally instead of exploited for the monetary gain of a societally advantaged management. Additionally, Americans would partner with Indian companies, improve their local economy, and grow jobs for both Indian and American workers, while catapulting technology forward in their sectors. This could be achieved if cost-cutting was not the main priority.
I was surprised by the analysis because I largely agreed with it. Working as a minimum-wage worker for two years while I had to be in school, surrounded by competent but disadvantaged people with families that they had to slave away to feed really touched me. I realized how much the bottom 50 percent has to offer the world when the top 3 percent own all of what we own, combined (Peters). I made ten dollars an hour cleaning the store, shipping out hundreds of items, helping customers, opening and closing the store, stocking the shelves, and so, so much more. I was not managing a Fortune 500 company, but what I was doing required time and energy which I feel and many others feel are not being properly compensated. Therefore, I agreed with Rawls when I heard his ethical arguments.
Jeff Bezos doesn’t need 177 billion dollars while 5 million people die each year from unsafe water-related illness in impoverished countries (Peters). I think that Jeff Bezos would benefit from hearing about Rawls’ theory of fairness. Although Amazon has a lot of power to help people, it also takes advantage of its workers, making them work long hours for very little (Peters). Society cannot improve if those in power make decisions based on their benefit instead of the benefit of mankind. Jeff Bezos should increase the wages of his workers and give some of his wealth to charities that support disadvantaged groups in tech.
I want to create and support technology and companies that do not prioritize their needs at the expense of others’ needs, instead working symbiotically to create a better environment for everyone. When individuals and companies work together using Rawls’ theories of social ethics, there is finally a possibility that the world will become a fairer, more diverse and kinder place. We can assist in this mutual goal by focusing our efforts on creating sustainable, safe, and well valued technologies.","Bibliography

CSC 300Z: Societal and Ethical Implications of Computing
September 14th, 2020","Since so many years ago, the ethical discussion has been developed a lot of centuries. In the age of ancient Greece, people started to concentrate on social ethics. Just like using tools and fire, ethics distinguish humankind and animals. Without ethics, human society is impossible to be built, so do the industry of computing. Compare with other industries, computing industry is very young, which may the youngest area in this world. Therefore, the restraints of the ethics of the computing industry are very important. Like other industries, for example, the cleaning industry. Although most of the cleaners have little wages than the others, they are still fair in their positions. Because they earn how much they worked. So, to help the youngest industry healthily grow up, the good ethics must be applied. A fair and correct ethic which is essential for the computing industry
Now a day, the ethical principles of the computing industry are not completed. They need to be improved in many different areas. There is an ethical problem that needs to be analyzed. Sara Baase talked about an assumption in her book “A Gift of Fire: Social, Legal, and Ethical Issues for Computing Technology”. The assumption assumes you are a company manager and you are holding a software project. As a manager, you need to decide to hire the American programmer with a high salary level or hire an Indian programmer with lower salary level. Also, the company is located in the United States, and the manager is an American. To discuss the ethical problem within this case, there are two kind of ideas which are both seems correct. However, the absolute correct answer is only one.
One of the ideas is based on utilitarianism. The utilitarianism is widely used on most computing technology firms. To minimize the cost of the project, choosing the Indian programmer is a good choice. For these managers, they seems made an ethical choice. In A Gift of Fire, Sara Baase said: “There does not appear to be any reason, from an ethical point of view, for placing a higher weight on the utility of one group of programmers merely because of their nationality.” Her statement tells us the hiring preference of nationality is not exist; only the business judgment. The reason looks like undoubtedly for us, because it seems fair enough for wherever the programmer comes from. However, the different consumption levels make the different programmer required different wages to lead this kind of fairness is not clear. American native workers are facing an imbalanced competition. Then, some social problems may happen.
The second idea of the case of hire U.S. programmers or Indian programmers needs to apply John Rawls’s thought, which means make the decision underneath another ethical standard. The Rawls’s thought which implemented on here is called “veil of ignorance”. The definition “veil of ignorance” from A Theories of Justice was written as: “It is assumed, then, that the parties do not know certain kinds of particular facts. First of all, no one knows his place in society, his class position or social status; nor does he know his fortune in the distribution of natural assets and abilities, his intelligence and strength, and the like.” Obviously, in order to make both United States and Indian programmers fair, we covered their background. If they have no nationality and wage level, the condition of hiring programmers could be much fair. In conclusion, the idea of the second would be shaped: To guarantee the case is ethical, the outer advantage or disadvantage which would affect the offers with any programmers should be eliminated.
Assume the first idea, utilitarianism rule the computing industry. Most American companies hired the Indian programmers more than the native programmer. The result of this phenomenon is a large number of unemployment and the negative induced emotion of civics. However, there is nothing unethical about choosing the cheaper of two products, services, or employees. But the social influence expresses it is not true. On the other hand, due to the impression of cheaper labor power, Indian workers are usually suffered terrible working environments. They are not born with cheaper value. Their home county just has a lower consumption level so they do not need wages as high as Americans. Also, some regions have the law to limit wages between native workers and foreign workers. If the United States applied the same law, there are no firms would hire Indian programmers. Because Indian programmers have no advantages, there are no reasons to hire them. Sara Baase also mentioned: “in Rawls’ view, an action or a social or political structure is not ethical if it has the effect of leaving the least-advantaged people worse than they were before (or would be in some alternative system).”Overall, pure utilitarianism leads an industry to many ethical problems. It is not ethical as we seen is the surface.
The best way for hiring programmers is applying the second idea which obey the Rawls’s fairness. We utilize the concept of “veil of ignorance”. After this, all employers abandoned the view that Indian programmer should be cheaper. For example, make all the applicants join a test. The test is faceless and the people who show the better programming ability have priority of the job. However, this method is not absolutely fair for anyone. The weaker American programmers who lost this opportunity. As native workers, in ethical aspect, they supposed to have more priority than foreign workers. Because they are born in the United States and supporting the domestic economy. In fact, lost this opportunity may not a bad thing for them. Maybe this job is not suit for them or they feel better with another company program. For the firms, give higher wages to Indian programmers establish better loyalty from them. Both company and applicants benefit from this rule. In the Rawls’s article Justice as Fairness, he claimed: “When any number of persons engage in a practice, or conduct a joint undertaking, according to rules, and thus restrict their liberty, those who have submitted to these restrictions when required have a right to a similar acquiescence on the part of those who have benefited by their submission. These conditions will, of course, obtain if a practice is correctly acknowledged to be fair, for in this case, all who participate in it will benefit from it.”. If everyone benefits from it, then it is fair, it is ethical. Inconclusion, this case has some details make people feel not fair enough, but is good for everyone, and fair from the inside.
Finally, the answer of the question of hiring the Indian or the American programmers was decided. The correct way is to make sure the companies in the computing industry eliminate programmers’ nationality, open the salary standard for everyone, and make people earn their estimated wage level by their abilities. Then, the unethical utilitarianism idea is out of time which needs to be abandoned.

In our lives we face many situations in which we must decide what is wrong and right and what is considered ethical and what is not. Since history, mankind has managed and has been asking the philosophical question of what is wrong and what is right and great philosophers of each age and have taught us about morality. Over time we have learned to pass legislation and develop laws to understand that how we can live together in peace without conflict. However, still today mankind has not been able to solve all its problems and is divided by war and conflict, by borders, where some countries are developed and some are underdeveloped, some are poor, and some are rich.
Philosophy is an interesting subject that has evolved over time as new concepts have been developed to answer the ethical questions in our minds. The subject of ethics can help us understand what morally correct and what policies should be passed to solve our problems. The different types of ethics are Metaethics, Normative ethics and Applied ethics (Caae). Metaethics is the study of the nature of ethics and moral reasoning (Caae) . Normative ethics ought to explain what our moral behavior should be, and applied ethics deals with human behavior (Caae).
Nowadays, computers and technology of today have completely transformed our lives of today and has led us to question about their ethical usage in society. New technologies of today have no doubt made our lives easy in many ways but have also brought new issues forward that we need to confront with. These issues include the privacy concerns related to computing, how our social behaviors have changed because of computers, and most importantly how computers of today affect the job market and employment.
In order understand these issues we must understand problems inherent with the computer industry of today and how equal and fair we are when we hire workers as software developers from abroad or from within our country. For example, if we are given  a choice between hiring Indian programmers vs US programmers we must ask our ourselves how ethical  we are when hiring someone and how much one should be paid based on his background and where he comes from (Baase  334).
Let us assume that the company is in the United States and the manager is choosing between Indian or US programmers. We must ask ourselves different questions before coming up with a fair and ethical conclusion. We should use the principle of utilitarianism and weigh in different scenarios to understand what is considered fair and just(Baase 334). We can the evaluate the utilities of both types of programmers by calculating the number of dollars the programmers will receive or the average salary in each country or by comparing the job opportunities available in both the countries(Baase 334). To answer this question we must also view through an ethical concept put forward by an American philosopher John Rawls.
John Rawls was born in Baltimore, Maryland and is known for his work on egalitarian liberalism in his work called the “ theory of justice”(Baase 37).  He earned a bachelor’s degree in 1943 from Princeton University and then went on to earn a PHD in moral philosophy from the same college in 1950 (Duignan). He taught at Princeton University , Massachusetts  Institute of Technology, and also at Harvard University(Duignam). He is  also known of being critical of Thomas Hobbes work (Baase 37). Thomas Hobbes believed that a rational man in search of a better life will give up his independence to follow a set of laws enforced upon him by some authority in society(Baase 37).  However,  John Rawls states that a society is not fair and ethical if  it  leaves its  poor and vulnerable members worse off(Baase 37).  He argues in favor of the utility of the least-advantaged people and comes with a solution or a concept to solve this problem(Baase 37). This concept is called the veil of ignorance(Baase 37). According to this concept, if we could imagine or think that an individual does not know his age , race, talents and wealth then we would make laws and policies that would be fair for everyone(Baase 37). Based, on this idea we can then judge whether it is ethical to hire Indian or US programmers(Baase 37). There might be several scenarios regarding this situation to decide whether it is ethical to hire US programmers or Indian programmers. If we hire Indian programmers they might be treated unfairly, exploited, charged with less money, and be asked to work in poor working conditions(Baase 334). They might be treated to an end to produce a cheaper product that is useful for the company, and might not even get medical insurance(Baase 334). However, paying US programmers more would be also be considered overpayment (Baase 334).  Furthermore, paying US programmers and Indian programmers the same amount of money would also be considered unfair as the incomes of US programmers would be protected and the demand of Indian programmers would decrease. Therefore, then the question arises what should be considered ethical and fair and what should be done to treat Indian programmers fairly. It can be possible that Indian programmers  can be paid not the same salary as US programmers but they could be paid more than what the market conditions or law requires, so that India programmers would be more motivated to work(Baase 334). This without doubt  would increase the company’s productivity, boost employees morale and Indian employees would be more loyal towards their company(Baase 334). Hiring the Indian programmers will without doubt be beneficial for the company as the lower price of the product will be offered to the customers and  the owners will also benefit from it(Baase 334). If the product becomes very successful then advertisement of the product will increase , which will  also hence increase the employment of people in the United States , as more people will be needed in the marketing industry(Baase 334).
Thus, in my opinion considering this the  manager should hire the Indian programmers and should pay the Indian programmers not the same amount of money as the US programmers , but should pay the Indian programmers beyond expectation of the market conditions and make sure that they receive good working environments to work in.
What I knew before making  this  analysis was that in the real world everybody is concerned about his or her  self-interest and profit and nobody thinks about such ethical questions. A great philosopher like John Rawls inspires generations to think about ethical questions that are important to make wise decisions.  His ethical theory  has proved useful in many situations however, many people seem to disagree with him as they claim that good people with knowledge of how the world works can come to different conclusion of how  to answer different ethical questions.  Such an analysis of Indian and US programmers can be a criterion to determine how ethics can be applied in industry to solve many of our problems. As computers and technology of today has transformed our world and changed the way we think we will face new problems, like for example the right to privacy and international relations . As the world has become a global village because of technology, we need philosophers  and thinkers in industry who can solve our problems and come up with ethical theories that are useful for us in this modern world that we  live in today.

1","The role of a manger in a business is to assemble a team that will fulfill the companies goals in an efficient, reliable, and precise way, if this means hiring employees from other countries that take less pay then it is not ethically immoral. I believe that as a manger of a software company that needs to work on a large software project picking competent programmers is more important than having to deal with the ethics of hiring programmers from other counties at a lower salary. While yes, hiring employees that can work for less is more beneficial for the company since they can allocate the money saved to other aspects of the project such as marketing, advertising, and distribution, which can provide jobs for non foreign employees, does it mean it’s ethical? Simply put yes, it is ethical to hire someone solely based on how much money they will receive. The ethical dilemma comes down to: should companies hire foreign workers simply because they don’t have to pay them as much as U.S workers? The answer is complicated and requires close study of different ethical viewpoints.
One way of looking at this question would be through utilitarianism, which is “an act is morally right if and only if the act causes ‘great happiness for the greatest number’.” I think that the parties involved, the customer, the employer, and the employees, would benefit overall from the hiring of Indian programmers. Hiring foreign employees for less money opens up more opportunity for U.S. employees since the money saved from hiring foreigners can be used to provide more jobs. Since the company is saving money that means the customer will also benefit since the product would then be sold for less. In the industry of computing one’s work should be taken into consideration before anything else, the person might be the right fit for the job or they
might not be at all in which case the problem changes from a ethical to a logical one. However, I believe that ethics in the computing industry is very important an example of why it’s important is because the computing industry is a ever growing entity that can be used for good and for bad, if a company is not ethical it will make their employees unethical which could have very big consequences on society. Another viewpoint would be to use the Kant principle which states, we can’t treat employees simply as a means to an end. This means that the reason for hiring the Indian programmers shouldn’t be only because they can be paid less but more for how good they are at their work. In Ethics of Hiring Foreign Workers by Sara Baase it says that “there is nothing inherently unethical about choosing the cheaper of two products, services, or employees”. This is seen this way because it’s a win-win for everyone, the buyers pay less of the product and the seller would be able to get a higher price for the product. An argument can be made when talking about hiring foreigners from India since they won’t have the same benefits as someone that works in the U.S. One of these benefits include uncrowded offices, since India holds rank two for most populous countries in the world in 2020. The goal of the manger is not to hire the Indian programmers to work in a harsh environment, that is simply out of the managers control and should not be seen as an argument on if it’s ethical or not. We can take a more philosophical look into the problem by reading Social Contracts and a Theory of Political Justice by Sara Baase which states “man is rational and will seek a better situation, even at the
cost of giving up some independence in favor of a set of laws and accepting some authority to enforce this “social contract””. This means that accepting a smaller pay is something people are willing to take if it means the outcome will be better than their current situation.
Adding to this John Rawls explains that “and action is not ethical if it has the effect of leaving the least-advantaged people worse than they were before”. This further supports my claim that hiring Indian programmers for less money is ethical since they are getting paid for their work and therefore leaving them better than they were before. Ethically if the manager holds the same ideas as John Rawls he might want to pay the Indian programmers the same or even more than the American programmers, this depends on the person and their knowledge on human behavior and economics and their understanding of the world. This would be beneficial because according to Baase “Paying more than expected might get you higher morale, better productivity, and increased company loyalty”. Finally, John Rawls’ term “veil of ignorance” supports my claim since it states “each person behind the veil of ignorance does not know his or her gender, age, race, talents, wealth…” . A correlation between the veil of ignorance and my claim to focus more on the individual and how well the programmer performs on their job can be made because both cases do not care about anything other than the work they do. Being ethical in business is important to keep a fair balance for all the employees. Recruiting Indian programmers for less pay can sound unethical but with the evidence given it is safe to say that it’s ethically moral.
In conclusion, a manger should pick his employees based on their hard work and dedication to the project and not only to save some money. Despite this, the problem of hiring certain group of people simply because they can get paid less is still considered to be ethical because it is providing more benefits for all parties involved, the customer, employer, and employees. I believe that the people who can benefit the most from my idea would be the company since they’ll get happy customers, save money, and still get a good product. The benefits of paying Indian programmers less outweighs the fact that they will be paid less than U.S. programmers since it’s in a humans nature to sacrifice something to be in a better situation than what they were in. Some argument can still be made about the “fairness” of getting paid less for the same job but, overall I believe that it’s the manager’s job to determine that. If the manager’s moral compass is similar to that of John Rawls then he would probably opt to pay the Indian programmers more because of the need to help those who are less fortunate, this also has the added benefit of increasing productivity and moral. Personally, I would pay the programmers based off their work and not take into consideration anything else, this can be seen as unethical to some since it could leave the less fortunate people worse than what they stared. A manager should see the hiring process through the “veil of ignorance” in where the employees were not hired through their wealth, race, gender, or age, but through fairness and hard work. To close off this report I have a thought provoking question, should a company value ethics more than the value of a finished product?","Bibliography

ja445758,,"Each year, technology plays a greater role in the human experience. From interacting with each other on social media, to ordering our Chipotle, each decision made in the development and creation of the tools we know and love today have a large impact on greater society. That is why it is crucial for those who are making these important decisions have a strong understanding of the principles by which we can assess the consequences of these decisions and come to some solution. The study of these principles is known as ethics.
With the new ability to speak with someone across the globe at the click of a button, the ethics of hiring foreign workers has become a hotly debated topic in todays political climate. In the book A Gift of Fire, Sara Baase and Timothy Henry discuss this exact dilemma [1], specifically the case of a US company choosing between hiring US workers or Indian workers, through two ethical lenses, utilitarian and Kant’s principle of humanity. When analyzing a problem, each moral principle will ask different questions. From the utilitarian perspective, the first thing that needs to be asked is by what metric you are measuring the utility of each choice to be? Examples of metrics that can be used to determine the utility of a choice given by Baase and Henry [1] are number of people hired, pay versus the average salary of that country, or the dollar amount a worker will receive. Clearly, this is not an exhaustive list of the metrics one can choose, however, they clearly highlight how much of an effect the metric has on the outcome. If the metric is the number of people hired, then there is no difference between choosing one worker or the other. If the metric is pay versus the average salary of that country, this favors the Indian workers. Lastly, if the metric is the dollar amount a worker will receive, this favors US workers.
When analyzing the problem through Kant’s principle of humanity, we seek to determine the solution that minimizes the use of people as a means to an end. Further, all the ways in which any effected party may be exploited must be assessed. Same as with utilitarianism, the conclusion you come to when analyzing a problem based on Kant’s principle of humanity depends entirely on how you frame the exploitation. As stated in A Gift of Fire, it would be just as easy to argue that you are exploiting the Indian workers by hiring them at a lower pay as it would be to say hiring the US workers is a wasteful expense and that hiring the Indian workers means the customer is given a more affordable product.
Another way to look that the moral dilemma of hiring foreign workers is through the moral and political philosophy called social contract theory. The concept of a social contract is by no means a new idea and can be traced as early as in the writings of Socrates [3]. However, after much development and a long hiatus, John Rawls’ A Theory of Justice, written in 1972, reinvigorated the study and development of the theory[ [3].  The foundation of this theory is that there is a basic set of agreed upon laws, known as the social contract, that are needed in order for a civil society to function. Rawls addition to the theory is the idea that people of good will can disagree based on their life experiences and that in order to maintain tolerance, “a proper political system protects basic civil liberties such as freedom of speech and free choice of occupation” [2]. Also included in Rawls’ philosophy is the concept that the utility of the least-advantaged far outweighs anyone else. Another idea Rawls’ brought to the social contract theory is the vail of ignorance. The veil of ignorance is the idea that a person is to create principles and policies with no knowledge of their own attributes such as age, gender, race, socioeconomic status, etc. The idea is that if a person does not know the “categories” in which they belong, they can not create policy which benefits their own groups interest [2].
When applying Rawls’ version of social contract theory to the problem of hiring foreign workers, there are many factors to be considered. The first thing to be considered is the domain of the social contract, or in other words, what are we defining as society. Is it the social contract that US residents abide by that is maintained by the US government? Is it a social contract between all people regardless of their nation? The answer to this question greatly affects who is chosen as the least advantaged group. In the situation that we are talking about a US social contract, the only group that need be considered are those who live within the society governed by said moral contract, making the US workers less advantaged by default. If it is the social contract that all people follow, then the Indian workers would be considered least advantaged due to less opportunity. In both of these scenarios we are assuming that it is beneficial for the worker to be employed. However, to take an example used to discuss Kant’s principle of humanity in A Gift of Fire, the company could be doing something to limit the opportunities of Indian workers [1]. If this were the case, it would be seen as more beneficial for the disadvantaged groups to hire the US programmers since the alternative would bring that group harm. These examples are only one way of analyzing this problem through the social contract. A completely different angle would be to view this problem from the point of view of the customer. The least advantaged group would be those who have the highest barrier to access to the product. In this case, it would be better for that group to hire the Indian workers and provide a cheaper product and benefiting them by lowering that barrier to access.
While I believe there are benefits to analyzing the problem through different domains of the social contract, the conclusion will be greatly influenced by the domain that matches the body making the decision. A decision made by the United Nations will be influenced greater by a different domain than the United Sates government. In the case of the United Nations, they would consider the Indian workers to be the least advantaged and would need to determine if their employment benefits that group overall. When taking into account all of the different angles from which you can look at this problem with the social contract theory, it is my opinion that the least advantaged group would be considered the Indian workers for reasons stated above, lack of access to opportunity, lower average economic status, etc. and that employing them would likely provide that group a net advantage. This conclusion is also supported when considering the customer of the company. The least advantaged group would be those who have a higher barrier to access for that product, therefore making the Indian workers the correct choice of hire, given that the product price will be lower as compared to if the company hired US workers.","References

15 September 2020","The Internet and its development are bringing humanity into a level of complexity that has truly never been witnessed or experienced before. Our connection to the Internet has grown into a two-way relationship, through which we imprint, but also receive, thoughts/feelings. I feel that as this process increases, the ethics of computers as tools begins to overlap with ethics regarding human behavior.
It’s possible to view smart devices as tools used by humans to fulfill their wishes and inspiration. A device like a cellphone is a tool like a wrench is a tool. Another view is that smart devices are tools used to fulfill our vision, but, with their connection to the Internet, extensions of ourselves and more deeply integrated with our psyches. Depending on where the metaphysical line is drawn between humans and their engagement with the World Wide Web, ethical values relating to such will be subject to change.
In this essay, I will show that the employment of foreign workers is inherently unethical. I will develop this argument around John Rawls’ conception of a social contract – specifically, the notion that an ethical society will benefit the least-advantaged group of people. To assist with the development of this theoretical contract, Rawls created the idea of the “original position”:
The original position is designed to be a fair and impartial point of view that is to be adopted in our reasoning about fundamental principles of justice. The main distinguishing feature of the original position is ‘the veil of ignorance’: to insure impartiality of judgment, the parties are deprived of all knowledge of their personal characteristics and social and historical circumstances.
Rawls theorized that, taking away any categorization of members of a society (age, gender, religious beliefs, etc.), all or most citizens would agree that “an action or a social or political structure is not ethical if it has the effect of leaving the least-advantaged people worse than they were before.” By using the veil of ignorance, members of a society can come to an unbiased consensus on policies/actions that benefit all members of the society.
Rawls’ notion of a social contract somewhat resembles the current democratic system in the U.S. At the very least, no person (or corporation), would publicly endorse a policy that explicitly favors one group over another, particularly if one group is less-advantaged. Realities of politics/policies aside, it’s reasonable to assume that any major corporation (including ones potentially hiring foreign workers), would, for their publicly-facing image, endorse a belief closely following Rawls’ notion of a social contract.
Assume that a company is debating whether to hire U.S. programmers or Indian programmers. Also assume that this company is well-known within the tech industry, and expends considerable resources maintaining a positive PR image. If asked its views on which groups of society should be benefitted, it would give a response in line with Rawls’ conception of a social contract: that the least-advantaged group in society should be benefitted. It might say this merely to not offend/repel any potential group of its client base, but for all intents and purposes, consumers will believe that this company operates by a code of ethics similar to Rawls’ contract.
On the surface, what are the factors motivating one to hire Indian programmers over U.S. programmers? The immediate answer is that it is cheaper to hire Indian programmers, that is, they will perform the same amount of work as U.S. workers, for lower wages. In this context, it may not seem entirely unethical to hire Indian programmers. From the company’s perspective, it is a cost-cutting strategy that allows for more money to be spent in other divisions, potentially furthering the company’s goal for providing better services to its customers. From behind the veil of ignorance, consider the ethics of hiring foreign workers: assuming no conception of race, ethnicity, or geographical location, what factors would motivate a company to hire foreign workers over domestic workers? Put simply, there would be no motivating factor in either direction.
From behind the veil of ignorance, there is no reason not to hire Indian programmers. However, since the work is outsourced to another country, the programmers will not be as emotionally invested in the company’s goals as programmers from the same origin country would. Furthermore, foreign programmers will benefit less -- or not at all -- from the benefits provided to the company by their work.
If programmers in India were bound to the social contract of the United States, then, compared to the degree of comfort in the mainland U.S., they would most certainly qualify as “least-advantaged,” being the most worthy of receiving aid. The very fact that the work is being “outsourced,” means that they are not bound to the social contract, and the company has less of an obligation to them as it would to programmers granted rights equal to its own.
As shown earlier, the main reason Indian programmers are able to work for lesser pay is due to categories like nationality and geographical location. From behind the veil of ignorance, there is little to no difference in the utility between U.S. programmers and Indian programmers. Indian programmers may not lie behind the veil of ignorance at all, since they are not reflecting thoughts and feelings back onto the U.S.’s sociopolitical identity.
The U.S., at least superficially, subscribes to an ethical theory similar to Rawls’ notion of a social contract. For this reason, the employment of Indian programmers is unethical within the context of the U.S. social contract. The utility of foreign workers – the ability to pay them lower wages -- is derived solely based on their status as outsiders, and not receiving the same resources as the employer which are granted under the social contract. This quote from Sara Baase further exemplifies why this is the case:
Some countries have laws that require the same salary be paid to all workers performing similar tasks to prevent employers from exploiting the less advantaged workers. Historically, a result of these laws is that the traditionally higher-paid group gets most of the jobs. (Often that has been the hidden intent of the law).
When forced to pay the same wages for outsourced labor, employers will hire workers from the traditionally higher-paid group. This shows that the main utility derived from employing foreign programmers is linked with their status as being outside the bounds of the social contract. This exposes a flaw in the philosophy and ethics behind the hiring of Indian programmers, as doing so is a contradiction in the company’s accordance with the social contract.
In writing this analysis, I gained insight into the mentality and philosophy behind the practice of outsourcing work. I also learned how answers to ethical problems and dilemmas can change depending on the ethical context in which the problem is posed. Before researching Rawls’ writings, I hadn’t considered the more fundamental ethical questions behind a democratic system/a system that provides for its weakest members. Through understanding Rawls’ conceptions of the original position and the veil of ignorance, I gained a better understanding of the motives behind and advantages of a democratic political system, and how it differs from other political systems, or none at all.
In conclusion, outsourcing work is unethical within the ethical system of providing for the least-advantaged group. Outsourcing work is equivalent to selectively extending certain aspects to the social contract, and withholding others. In this sense, it is a contradiction and a violation of the rules of the social contract.","References

9/12/2020","The importance of ethics within the computing industry is tantamount, and the decisions made today will have a large impact on a field that is already pushing the boundaries and creating new controversial situations all the time. This applies as well to the hiring process of course as technology is advancing it is becoming ever easier for companies to hire outside of their general areas. People can work remotely which allows for options to hire outside of country where previously it might have been harder. This then brings up the controversy of whether it is ethical to choose to hire someone from another country if it is to save the company money but in turn not hire someone from the home country of the business.
There are many different opinions to this topic one of which is that it is wrong because you are taking jobs away from people in the country that acts as your company’s base of operations. Where as another point of view would be that if you are able to get work at a cheaper rate, then you can in turn make more money which will allow the company to hire to require hiring for other things. Some examples of those could before advertising or distribution of a product which can create more jobs then would have possibly be taken away from hiring from overseas. There are even points made against whether it is ethical to pay the people from another country less than you would pay the people from your home country or vice versa, where people believe it is not ethical to pay inflated wages when you can get labor for cheaper. On top of that there is the consideration of working conditions and it is very common that in other countries where you can get labor for cheaper, that the working conditions may be no where near what one might consider ethical.
Rawls has an opinion that “justice as fairness” where the concept of justice is to be decided by the parties involved in what is going to be deemed as fair or not. As well as that the idea of justice can chance varying on the environment as well as balancing out as much satisfaction as possible. While there may be some things that one might not find satisfactory it might in turn be found to be favorable by them due to the environmental conditions that they are accustomed to. This can be applied directly to a lot of the controversial ethical issues such as if paying them less is still considered ethical. Well looking at it from a standpoint of how much satisfaction can be garnered from it then you assume they are being payed the wages that they are asking for as well as the company is saving money by hiring them. It would be fair since while it may not be up to par for the standards of the environment in a different country it may be more than fair for what their current situation is. This is ultimately in line with the utilitarian idea of what brings about the greatest good. The only thing here that becomes harder to quantify is if the working conditions are not at least satisfactory and they are suffering in the state that they are in. How does that quantify against the net gain that the company would gain by hiring them and saving money? Is it then possible to quantify whether it is in turn fair? Being that I think suffering is too hard to put a quantifiable value on overall based on Rawls opinions the idea of hiring overseas would not be ethical because it could not be just. Arguing that the suffering of others could be balanced out by a monetary gain by a company would not be possible.
The results of that line of thinking are about what I would have expected from the beginning because while its easy to view the idea of offshore hiring as an ethical practice from the standpoint of a business because of the net monetary gains. Its easy to forget to view things from a “veil of ignorance” where you would quickly be able to see that the pros do not equal the cons in any way. Though before reading the analysis I would not have thought of many of the reasons that can be used to debate the ethics of hiring overseas. There were a lot of “butterfly effect” things to take into consideration such as how it could possibly effect even a whole area if you were to hire overseas in a positive way for instance building a factory somewhere which could create a stable source of income for an area along with lots of jobs. Or the side of it creating other jobs such as higher up positions while offshore hiring can take away a lot of lower level work or even specialized work like programming, having the extra money can allow companies a lot of flexibility in things that they can do in the future or positions they can hire for.
The people who could use this kind of information could be hiring managers or even business owners when they make the decisions on whether to hire offshore labor or not. They could use it to make better choices when deciding where to hire by possibly seeing what kind of effect hiring people from a certain area might have on the economy there and if it will be good overall or not. It can even be used by people who study economics and or ethics as well and used as an example for studies or advising to larger companies that can afford to have that done. The companies could use the ideas to create different benefit packages for foreign workers since often they will not receive the same benefits that someone working in the same area would. This would tip the scales in the favor of hiring offshore doing better than it is bad and could be the difference between non-ethical and ethical offshore hiring.
In conclusion I believe that the idea of ethics in the computer industry is very important especially when it comes to the idea of offshore hiring. This can largely be attributed to the fact that human rights and basic needs are hard to quantify when it comes to comparing it to the monetary gain that a company might receive. Agreeing with what Rawls opinion was on the matter we can say that there must be a decent amount of benefits besides just money in order to balance out the suffering that some might go through in sub-par working conditions. This in turn makes it so that you must be extra sure that something is going to be deemed “fair” before making the ultimate decision of declaring it ethical by adjusting accordingly but for the most part in the current state a lot of offshore hiring is not considered ethical.","Bibliography

09/15/2020 Vladimir Kuperman Societal and Ethical Implications of Computing","As an aspiring Computer Scientist my vision of the ethics in the industry of computing, would be for everyone to get the same opportunity as others no matter age, race, gender or religious beliefs. It is a known fact people of color have a much more difficult time acquiring the same jobs and positions of the people in power. For example the top major companies in the United States like Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft have more than 50 percent Caucasian employees and about 6 percent African American employees. In each one of those companies there is a major inequality of the ratio of African American workers to Caucasian workers. This is a prime example of when my vision of ethics can affect that inequality. Therefore more people of color would get the same opportunity as the people in office. My vision of ethics will not only improve the workplace but it will create a better environment for all people, this will also create a better image for any company which will attract new or existing customers and future employees. Another reason my vision on ethics is important in the computing industry is because in the workplace many people won't feel comfortable unless they see another person that looks like them or speaks the same language as them. When the environment of the workplace is diverse it will increase productivity when everyone is satisfied with their surroundings.  People of color have been at a disadvantage because they aren't given the same amount of access to education and resources than others. Students living in the inner city urban area have less access to learn about computing and programming while in other more suburban areas these classes were given to students at a young age. Therefore increasing the chances of more suburban students going to college to be a computer scientist. This method has created a domino effect of race inequality in the computing industry leaving more people of color with less freedom to gain access obtaining positions in power. That is a prime example of why it is important to give everyone the same opportunity to level the playing field. Secondly everyone should know the principles of Ethical Implications in Computing is necessary for the simple fact that people of color are less likely to be hired because they’re set at an disadvantage. As many know Philosophy has a very big role till this day in the computing industry,here are some philosophers that had an influence on this essay. John Rawls and Immanuel​	 Kant, John​	 Rawls was born February 21 1921 he was an American political philosopher in the liberal​	 tradition. Once he had aged he created a very popular theory on justice and fairness which describes a society of free citizens holding equal basic rights and cooperating within an egalitarian economic system.
Immanuel Kant was born April 22 1724 he was a philosopher ​	that synthesized early modern​	 rationalism and empiricism and set the terms for much of nineteenth and twentieth century philosophy.
In some cases it is understandable that people will have different views on the same topic one theory to this viewpoint could be the positive and negative rights created by John Rawls. The problem is people of color not getting the same opportunities as others. That problem hasn't gone unnoticed so Companies have mandated programs such as “Affirmative Action” This program is just for african americans or a minority to be accepted into major companies. This program is a positive right because it will give more people of color the opportunity to make a change and add diversity to each company. Although it has a great positive right there is also a negative right to this example. Since this person would be accepted solely on the color of their skin it may have an affect on the work environment if nobody knows if this new hire is qualified for this job or did the company need to make a quota. This theory focuses on societal fairness which is an aspect of our social contract. John Rawls' ideas were helpful to the less fortunate he stated in the article by Benn Steil and Manuel Hinds - Social contracts and a theory of political justice “an action or a social or political structure is not ethical if it has the effect of leaving the least-advantaged people worse than they were before”, This is where new theories of fairness were introduced into society in which people decided what was right or wrong in society. Furthermore there are multiple ways to look at these scenarios. Another way to look at this topic is from Immanuel
Kant point of view in which would be known as Deontological theories. The definition of a Deontological theory is absolute rules to be followed whether they lead to good or ill consequences in particular cases. As stated in the textbook -​ A Gift of Fire Social, Legal, and Ethical Issues for Computing Technology an example of a Deontological theory is “We should​	 follow rules of behavior that we can universally apply to everyone”. Therefore this theory would be ideal for the topic of race inequality, if a person of color is accepted to a top corporation because there is a mandatory quota that says its needed for one african american or one Hispanic american to be hired in order for them to keep in business is it ethically right for them to hire an under qualified candidate over someone who meets the criteria. Furthermore John Rawls has many views on society one example is The Two Principles of Justice as Fairness this is where he explains the guiding ideas of justice as fairness are given an institutional form. The first​	 principle is each person is deserving of the same liberties on an equal level. The second principle is Social and economic inequalities need to satisfy two conditions, the first condition is in work spaces and high positions there needs to be equal opportunity for everyone. Those two principles connect with this topic for the simple fact people of color have not been given equal opportunity to succeed. When John Rawls views on ethics are implemented in the technology industry there will be an increase in work productivity and people of color joining the tech industry. While writing this essay it became very interesting to me to see John Rawls philosophy and views on ethics. Before this assignment I had only known about his views on Positive Rights and Negative rights but throughout this assignment I did more research not only to find out John Rawls had multiple views on society and the principles of fairness but he has a lot of the same viewpoints as me. As I was reading through these articles it gave me a lot to think about, some views I agreed with and some I disagreed with but the most important thing this assignment has taught me is this different viewpoints of ethics from different philosophers such as John Rawls and Immanuel Kant.
In Conclusion John Rawls philosophy on ethics still has its importance today because of the race inequality in the computing industry his views explains the importance of giving least-advantaged members of society the same opportunities as others​	. In my opinion John​	 Rawls views are very important to society and should have a major impact on the ethics of this 20th century computing industry. The main reason his views are still important is because people that are less fortunate are often looked over and passed up for opportunities, when John Rawls views are being implemented society will balance out and people of color will get the same opportunities for success in the computing industry. Therefore everyone should know the principles of Ethical Implications in Computing is necessary for the simple fact that people of color are less likely to be hired because they’re set at an disadvantage.","Reference Page

9/15/2020","Ethics in the industry of computing is very important, without a set standard of ethics technology could go very far in the direction of evil.  Black hat hackers and many other types of criminals already use the internet and computers in malicious and evil ways every day.  More specifically, the ethics of American companies outsourcing their jobs to foreign employees has been a conversation for a long time.  According to Conor Sen in a 2018 Bloomberg article, “Outsourcing tech jobs is nothing new. Fairchild Semiconductor… opened its first Hong Kong factory in 1964,” he goes on to tell us “IBM now has more employees in India than in the U.S.” [1].  The views on this topic may vary from person to person, and they may all be correct based on different ethical ideologies. While the book [2], uses “utilitarianism and Kant’s principle about treating people as ends in themselves” to look at this situation, I will be looking at this issue using John Rawls’ social contract theory, specifically the veil of ignorance [3].  When using Rawls’ “veil of ignorance” [3], there is nothing ethically wrong with hiring Indian, or any foreign, programmers, as long as the salary paid is an acceptable wage in their country and the company is not laying off workers in order to outsource.
Texas McCombs School of Business states in a 2018 YouTube video that “the social contract should guarantee that everyone has an equal opportunity to prosper” [4].  Excluding foreign workers to work for American companies based on only their nationality breaks this rule and does not give foreign programmers an equal opportunity to prosper.  They also state that “any advantages in the contract should be available to everyone,” further strengthen the point that foreign workers are just as entitled to work as American programmers, as they deserve just as many advantages [4].  The Texas school also says in their Ethics Unwrapped article that “according to the liberty principle, the social contract should try to ensure that everyone enjoys the maximum liberty possible without intruding upon the freedom of others” [5].  Restricting jobs at American companies to only American workers, especially jobs that can be done remotely and are mostly done remotely by even American workers, is intruding on the freedom of occupation of foreign programmers.
Sam Harnett talks about the issue of IT jobs moving to India specifically in a 2016 NPR article [6].  In this article he describes the story of an IT worker, Hank Nguyen, laid off in favor of Indian workers who accepted a lower salary.  When describing companies outsourcing jobs to India, Harnett uses words like “really scary”, and “silent destruction” [6].  After his layoff, Nguyen is worried about his daughter’s future in the computer science industry, as she was in college with plans to enter the same field as her faither at the time of his layoff.  It is clear from the article that Harnett and Nguyen do not agree with the ethics of hiring foreign programmers to replace the jobs of American programmers.  In this specific case I also believe Nguyen’s employer laying him off in favor of cheaper labor in India was unethical.
In a 2019 BayTech Consulting blog [7], Bryan Reynolds discusses the pros and cons of software development outsourcing to foreign countries.  Reynolds makes a good point when he states that “these projects are not the time to go hunting for new employees and trying to assemble a team on the fly” he also tells us that “when you go with … a proven firm like Baytech Consulting, you’re getting the services of a company that has recruited the best talent from around the country” [7].  This applies with the scenario given in [2].  If you are about to start a large project, knowing there is nothing ethically wrong with outsourcing the jobs, it makes more sense to work with a large firm who already has a team put together for you.  Reynolds uses similar logic to express the fact that a large firm that specializes in outsourcing programmers can match you with the perfect programmer(s) who are experts in the specific language or skill you need for the job.
If I was the manager at a software company and I needed to hire dozens of employees for a project quickly, I would choose the employees that offer the best work, have the best knowledge, and can do the job for the best price.  Usually, the best price means the company must outsource the jobs to foreign workers.  Knowing that said project will be done completely via the internet is a “veil of ignorance” in and of itself almost.  When working with programmers completely over the internet, if the only thing you were to see from them is code, you would have no idea where they are from, what race they are, how much wealth they have, or anything about them.  If I were to hire programmers for this job, I would look through with a veil of ignorance, only looking at which programmers know the language, and software the best [3].  If an Indian programmer knows just as much or more as an American programmer and wants a lesser but still fair wage for the same quality of work, there is nothing ethically wrong about hiring the Indian programmer.
Before doing this analysis, I always just assumed that companies such as Fairchild, Foxconn, Google, and IBM who outsource work to other countries were just unamerican.  I had believed that taking jobs from American programmers was unfair, especially since that is the field I will be entering.  Why would I want more competition?  From the eyes of an employee, or future employee, it is easy to see why jobs that are outsourced are look down upon and not favored buy American programmers.  Although, after doing the research on this subject I cannot blame companies or call them the bad guys, as I can see why they would do this.  Even I would do this if I was a manager at a large company.  Using the veil of ignorance, the ethics behind this are not evil, and there is nothing ethically wrong with doing so, in fact it is the ethically right thing to do for the company [3].  I believe this analysis could be used by people who think the ethics behind outsourcing programming jobs to foreign countries is flawed or evil.  By reading this analysis people who do not support companies doing this can at least understand why they do it, and why it is ethically correct.
After researching this topic and analyzing multiple articles, I still believe my original hypothesis stands correct.  Companies who outsource programming jobs to other countries are not ethically wrong for doing so.  As long as these companies are paying the outsourced employees a wage that is fair in their country and the company is not laying off its workers in order to outsource, there is nothing wrong happening.  Workers in other countries deserve to work for American companies just as much as Americans if they have the skills necessary.  If a project is fully online there is nothing preventing a foreign worker from doing the same quality, if not better, job than an American.","References

Societal and Ethical Implications of Computing
9/15/2020","Hulbert 1

	In the modern age, the ethics of computing has become a more important question than ever before. Computers have opened up countless communications across the globe. You can connect and talk to someone on the other side of the world in the blink of an eye thanks to modern technology. But as the phrase goes, “with great power, comes great responsibility.” Of course its amazing what we can do with all of this tech, but increased communications means there are more ways for us to affect each other as well. And if we can affect each other, then we can hurt each other. Thus, the importance of ethics; to establish guidelines for human behavior that help minimize the pain and maximize the gain of the populace.
	The problem is, Technology is pretty new in the grand scheme of things. We have brilliant philosophers and theorists throughout the ages, that are well recognized by their thoughts on ethics. Socrates is over 2000 years old, the philosophes ideas are from 300 years ago, Nietsche a little over 100, and even John Rawls theories of ethics where released in their final state around 20 years ago.(John Rawls (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy), 2020) However, even as little as 20 years ago, the world was a very different place. Not everyone even had a cell phone yet, but here we are, 20 years later, and everyone has a computer in their pocket.
	This has brought a lot of new interactions, and with it, entire new applications of the study of ethics. I will be focusing on interpreting John Rawl’s Social Contract Theory, which he proposed in 1971 in a book known as “A Theory of Justice,” and refined up until his last work in 2001 “Justice as Fairness.”(John Rawls (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy), 2020)  I will be applying his insights of ethics on a more modern problem; The working conditions and accessibility of programmers.
	John Rawls theorized that there were two primary principles of justice.
The first that;
“Each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive total system of equal basic liberties compatible with a similar system of liberty for all.” 
(A Theory of Justice | Wikiwand, 2020) 

and the second:
""Social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are both:
(a) to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged, consistent with the just savings principle, and
(b) attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity.""
(A Theory of Justice | Wikiwand, 2020) 

	John Rawls believed that any reasonable group of people would inevitably come to the conclusion that there must be some system of laws in place to facilitate a common good, much like Thomas Hobbes in the 17th century.(Baase, 2012)  He gave immense value to the “least advantaged” members of society. In fact, some scholars can be quoted saying “Rawls gives far more weight (indeed, infinite weight) to the utility of the least-advantaged people than to anyone else.“(Baase, 2012)  I think the utility of this is obvious, you could consider it like raising the floor so that we can collectively jump higher. In respect to that, it seems suitable ethically to hire workers from overseas, as they are often less advantaged, and could benefit from the job.
	You could argue that it actually has a negative effect on both parties. The overseas workers may not be getting paid enough for the job, or may have long hours, or other malignant working conditions. In such a case we could say that the employers are taking advantage of the less advantaged party. And of course, it could be argued that regardless, a programmer is not part of the “least-advantaged” group and therefore these aspects of John Rawls theory do not apply, and thus hiring either party is not unethical by this standard.
Hulbert 2
Beyond that, Rawls proposed a thought experiment known as the “veil of ignorance” in order to test whether a law was just.(Baase, 2012)  This is also sometimes referenced as the “original position.”(A Theory of Justice | Wikiwand, 2020) By this principle, If you were to pretend you don’t know your inherited traits, such as age, sex, race, wealth, or talents, and can still consider a law fair from that position, then that is a decent foundation for a just law. By this test, you could say that hiring either from the homeland or overseas are equivalently ethical.
	Of course, much of this depends on what frame of reference you view the social contract from. For instance, should a social contract of a government and it’s people, allow outsourcing of jobs? As the foreign employees are not a part of this particular social contract, one could say that you should never outsource to a foreign workforce, because it is the governments duty to ensure that opportunity exists for it’s own people.
	On the other hand, If you consider a social contract between a company, it’s consumers, and it’s employees, then things reach more of a grey area. In this social contract the company has a responsibility to both it’s workers and it’s consumers. The responsibility to the workers will change based on which workers they hire, so it is almost irrelevant to the problem. However, Their responsibility to their consumers asks that they try to keep their prices lower and products available, which could make the case that if a company can cut costs then it can better suit the needs of it’s consumers. In this case it has better ethical implications to hire foreign workers for cheaper.
	Rawls believed in making a fair society, that had a place for many different types of race, or religion, or lifestyles. He hoped that by agreeing to a common procedure we could get along. I think that ideally, Rawl would want a company to provide the best opportunity they could to the least advantaged, and that a government should facilitate trade to fill the needs of its people. The integration of a foreign workforce could end up being another culture loyal to the social contract. However the real world is not ideal. I believe that Rawls understood the importance for the people to agree with the rules imposed on them by their social contract, and would expect that we use the finer details of the situation to make a more informed opinion about which workforce would be more beneficial to the whole. Rawls was an ethical theorist after all, he wished to improve our better natures, rather than dictate what they are. His social contract theories exist as guidelines to facilitate positive, useful relationships between it’s constituents. It is meant to fill a role that can’t be filled by more strict and in depth systems.

Abstract:","The debate on the ethical dilemma surrounding the use of resources in this rapid development in computing is ever increasing. The conclusion of the discussion is often based on different theories with their own distinct perspectives. In this essay, we will analyze the ethical aspects of a certain problem we are facing now and determine whether the scenario is ethically permissible by applying some of the normative ethical theories
Normative ethical theories are useful tools to make a moral decision besides the ethical dilemma. It is especially significant these days to discuss ethics since the ubiquity of computing highlights the importance of ethics that computing professionals and the users should be aware of. As the use of a computer is ever popularizing and expanding in a great acceleration over time, it is undoubtedly impacting on our lives than ever before. A wide area network expanded via the Internet and rapid technological development are providing people both advantages and disadvantages. At this moment, understanding of the importance of ethics for the industry of computing is getting more critical not only for programmers but also for users. This is because the drawbacks, such as security problems, information leaks, or plagiarism issues, can seriously impact on our social life. It became essential to be aware of that computing, what we are living with, can have significant societal and ethical implications since we can be either victim or the other whether we intend to or not. However, it is hard to make a confident decision besides the ethical dilemma.
There are different views and approaches to deal with the dilemma that we can have in decision making. The section titled, ""Ethics of Hiring Foreign Workers,"" opened the discussion with the topic of whether to hire U.S. programmers or Indian programmers in an ethical perspective. The authors covered both sides in a neutral position to introduce how two different normative ethical theories; utilitarianism and Kant's principle, can lead to different decisions. They stated that the net utility, one of the measurement for decision making in such a dilemma, can be calculated depending on ""how one evaluates the utility of the job for each group of programmers"" in the utilitarianism perspective. However, the weight of one's utility can be calculated subjectively because Utilitarianism only focuses on the consequences of actions. What becomes the criteria decide its utility. On the other hand, Kant's principle, one of the deontological moral theories, focuses on duties. It is also introduced in the section that human beings should be treated as ends in themselves in Kant's theory. In this perspective integrated into the practice that foreign workers often have not been treated as same as local workers, it would be more likely considered unethical to hire Indian programmers with insufficient respect. Like this, it is not easy to decide which decision or viewpoint to be more ""right"" than the other.
However, we know how ethics is important especially for our social life in this century. I believe we should consider ethics as the priority when we face a moral dilemma and when it comes beyond the individual case. John Rawls is a modern philosopher whose perspective is one of the useful ethical guidelines [1]. I especially support Rawls's ideas in the ""veil of ignorance,"" which argues that every individual is an equal being in the concept of the ""original position [2]."" He explained that since no one knows where he or she belongs to behind the veil of ignorance, the principles of justice chosen behind the veil of ignorance ""ensures that no one is advantaged or disadvantaged in the choice of principles by the outcome of natural chance or the contingency of social circumstances [2]."" However, the real world is not like that. There will be a variety, which would be the potential to bring the chance of discrimination, in the natural distribution [4].  Accordingly, Rawls puts more weight on the utility of the most vulnerable and least-advantaged groups of society to pursue equality [1]. It may seem like it makes his view of justice as fairness inconsistent. But it is still to make policies ""fair for all"" by protecting them. From this circumstance derived from the original position, he said, ""the symmetry of everyone's relations to each other, this initial situation is fair between individuals as moral persons [2]."" In other words, the moral powers would be from the basis of equality, the features of human beings in virtue of which they are to be treated in accordance with the principles of justice.
After we understand Rawls's idea, we shall want to see the scenario in more general points of view. Is it ethically permissible to hire foreign workers just because they are willing to be paid less? Or, is it ethically permissible to treat them differently to compare with U.S. programmers because they are foreigners, who are not subject to be protected under most of U.S. laws? Applying Rawls's theory of justice, it is not ethical if one is not treated as same as human beings promised to all from the original position. It is more unlikely permissible if we consider that we are dealing with Indian programmers who are living in worse conditions than those in the U.S. in general. Regarding that, we shall rather pay more or at least the same amount of what U.S. programmers get paid to Indian programmers in the sense of shared humanity and of tolerance [1]. Even one of Rawls's principles for ordering the international basic structure said, ""Peoples have a duty to assist other peoples living under unfavorable conditions that prevent their having a just or decent political and social regime [3]."" It implies that it is ethically reasonable to decide to hire them even though they are not citizens of the U.S. The authors in the textbook [1] also mentioned that it is not an ethical action if it leads the least-advantaged people to worse condition. Therefore, if the manager hires them in a lower wage and ignores their poor work environment, it is certainly against what ethics Rawls regards as important. In addition, he focuses more on liberties, which are often called negative rights, that support the right to act without interference. In this perspective, it is also fair or just if the manager hires Indian programmers at a lower salary because the manager can claim the right to use ""labor, skills, and mind to create goods and services and to trade with other people in voluntary exchanges [1]."" In my opinion, however, most of Rawls's viewpoint promotes to emerge its immorality than ethical aspects.
Moral problems can be discussed in a variety of fields according to different theoretical perspectives. Before this analysis, I never expected that ethics would be discussed in this way. For me, ethical issues in the industry of computing would be debated in more technical topics than general subjects. I have even realized that my vision of the importance of ethics for the industry of computing I wrote in the early part of this essay never included this new kind of understanding of ethics. And finally, I have recognized that the moral dilemmas of foreign labor have been consciously or unconsciously neglected even by myself. Now, I can see how serious it is to consider. Employing foreign workers is a good example that reflects a crucial ethical dilemma regarding the moral obligations of not only the employers but also the government authorities. While my analysis based on Rawls's theory made me criticize the given scenario, there is a number of other theories than can end up the opposite conclusion. I believe this analysis would help those who are working in world-wide organizations responsible for global issues. Even if they are working for their own profits and are having difficulty to take ethical suggestions fully into the real problems, it is still appliable because Rawls's theory suggests a decision based on rationality, not just ethics. Regarding all of these, I personally conclude that it is unethical to hire foreign workers at a lower salary compared to local workers.","References

Abstract","Ethics affect the industry of computing in many ways. The study of how ethics affect the industry of computing can help others understand how these ethical concepts work.  The topic that will be discussed is offshoring with a base case where a company is deciding on whether to hire programmers from the US or India. To examine the possible solutions three ethical concepts will be discussed. Consequentialism, deontological ethics, and the social contract theory by John Rawls. The base case is used throughout the discussion to illustrate how ethics affect topics such as off shoring in the industry of computing. A real example of how salaries work in the industry provides an edge to some of the applications that are presented. The study of the base case results in a deeper understanding of how ethics apply in computing. This conclusion does not provide an actual solution to the base case it provides an approach to this ethical situation. This study provides different perspectives on this case and further studies can be made with more ethical approaches.",".

With the development of technology, there is an importance to demonstrate how ethics play a role in the industry of computing. It is important to clarify what ethics are as individuals become exposed to the industry of computing every day. Although ethics can take different implications depending on the viewpoints considered, the common objective is to establish principles. In the industry of computing ethical situations arise that can apply to users, developers and professionals. The three ethical concepts that will be discussed are consequentialism, deontological ethics, and the social contract theory by John Rawls. These concepts will help analyze offshoring; a common practice seen in the industry of computing. The base case for the ethical concepts is the idea whether companies should hire US programmers or Indian programmers. There is not a definitive way to conclude this base case, still the ethical theories present different views that provide ways in which you can come to a solution.
The consequentialism approach describes an ethical concept that focuses on the effects of actions. Within this concept the idea of utilitarianism exists, according to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy “Utilitarianism is also distinguished by impartiality and agentneutrality. Everyone's happiness counts the same.” [1] This approach can be applied to the base case that presents the comparison of a company hiring programmers in the US or India. The action taken can be deemed morally right if the decision results in the greatest happiness for a majority of the people involved. The application of utilitarianism to the base case will result in the company being the majority and the ultimate decision being the best for them. Generally, the company’s financial aspects, outlook, and company growth would be taken into consideration.  However, by applying this ethical approach it is identifiable that the solution shall be determined by the company’s happiness and not the programmers. The utilitarianism approach results in both decisions being a choice for the company. For example, the company may consider hiring US programmers to avoid paying for international agreements and fees. The US programmers would save the company money therefore resulting in higher wages and a positive outlook for the company. Similarly, hiring the programmers from India would create partnering opportunities and cause expansion for the company. Thus, the ethics of the actions presented examined under the consequentialism approach would equally result in success for the company.
There is not one way to look at ethics, one of the most widespread methods to consider is the deontological concept. By applying this approach, the focus is on the “duty” describing the motivation behind the act. The most famous philosopher Immanuel Kant stated that the duty must follow the categorical imperative. In essence, the act must have an unconditional requirement that can be applied to everyone and then follow the maxim rule. In the base case said earlier the maxim rule would result in a solution that is best for the programmers. Typically factors that the programmers would consider are pay, workers compensation and overall benefit of their employment within the company. Nevertheless, the deontological approach considers the maxim rule that states that the system is moral if it can be adapted by everyone. This is precisely why the solution to the base case will result in programmers from both sides to be hired. By adopting the deontological approach, the only answer is for the programmers to be treated equally. As a result, the decision fulfills the categorical imperative, a vital component to this approach. Ultimately, the programmers benefit from the decision and are in a better position than how they began.
One more ethical concept to consider is the “Social Contract Theory” presented by modern philosopher John Rawls. In principle its states that people will abide by rules presented by a political structure to maintain social order. This principle also enforces civil liberties and freedom rights as principles.  In a brief overview a party must be better off after the action is taken, if the party does not gain the system is considered not ethical. In the Encyclopedia of Philosophy it is mentioned that “the difference principle allows inequalities of wealth and income, so long as these will be to everyone's advantage, and specifically to the advantage of those who will be worst off.”[2] Applying John Rawls’ “veal of ignorance” would remove bias from the decision. Factors like contemplating whether the programmers are from the United States or India would not be taken into consideration. These factors have an impact on judgment therefore are ignored when this method is applied to the base case. The most valuable use of this concept indicates that the Indian programmers benefit the least, this builds up the comparison between the company and programmers.
The ethical concepts described above supplied various perspectives on how to approach the moral solution for the base case. Bearing in mind the analysis of all the theories the base case has come to the conclusion that the programmers from India would be best to hire for the company. The article “Software Engineer/Developer Salary in India in 2020” by Rohan Vats a software engineering manager at UpGrad, an online higher education platform that presents essential information to prospective students.  Several examples are shown that represent what average salaries for Indian programmers look like on a yearly basis. [3] An example that was intriguing was the average salary paid to Cisco programmers in India, the salary was about a million rupees, which is 13,622.73 US dollars. [4] According to job sites like indeed the minimum salary at Cisco for junior application engineers in the US is $89,450 per year.[5] The drastic change in salaries is evident. Several reasons why there is a change in salaries is that the economic markets fluctuate, and the cost of living differentiate. For that reason, this is a minimal example that shows how Indian programmers are disadvantaged in the comparison of wages.  If applying John Rawls’ theory, the solution would be best for the Indian programmers to be hired as they will be able to benefit more.
Before the ethical concepts were clarified one would think that the main ethical problem is the difference in locations between the programmers. One would also think that the ethical solution is the one that saves the most money for the company. When studying various ethical methods, it is established that there are many ways to approach a case. Though that is essential what is important is that the principles established follow morality and that the action taken does not infringe upon individuals’ rights. Justice must be maintained throughout the decision. The results of the analysis of ethics in offshoring can be used for individuals seeking insight on how ethical approaches work in the industry of computing. In conclusion, ethics will always change depending on the view taken, what will not change is the basic idea that is to protect and justify actions for individuals.

jp342446,,"The computing industry is a rapidly expanding and ever evolving one. As breakthroughs are made, drastic changes are often implemented in short time frames, creating large ripples that globally impact people. Specifically, labor in computing and the hiring practices of computing firms has a massive effect on not only those working within the industry, but impact everybody from consumer to shareholder. The importance of these practices makes it even more important to establish clear ethical guidelines in regard to how computing companies hire and manage their labor. This cannot be understated, and through the examination of preexisting ethical guidelines and multiple different viewpoints, a picture of just how important a solid ethical foundation is in the computing industry will be made clear.
In order to discuss the labor hiring and management practices within the computing industry, we must explore different viewpoints. A key aspect of this will be a discussion of the implications of offshoring, which is defined as “the movement of jobs and tasks from one country to another, usually from high-cost countries, such as the United States, to low-cost countries where wages are significantly lower”. The first viewpoint I’d like to explore is that of a software company faced with either hiring somebody domestically (in the U.S.) or hiring somebody from a different country for a lower price. This perspective is explored in detail in the excerpt “Ethics of hiring foreign workers”, and it explains that there are numerous factors one must consider when examining the ethics of offshoring versus hiring domestically. Obviously, paying lower wages to produce the same product is a favorable scenario for all companies, but the impact of doing this is not as clear cut. From the perspective of a foreign worker, one might say that the U.S. based company is exploiting their location and financial situation in order to pay them less for their work. Similarly, is it fair to the U.S. based programmer, whose skill is presumably equal to the foreign worker, that they are not being hired simply because they live in a place where the wages would be higher? In my opinion, this is likely bad faith and ethically questionable behavior on the part of the U.S. based firm. This behavior can easily be seen as predatory and exploitative of foreign tech workers, as they are more likely to accept lower pay for the same work that a U.S. based employee would do. However, offshoring is not necessarily unethical, and it can be quite beneficial to the local economies of the foreign worker’s community. It will never be easy to spot this distinction, but it is nonetheless an important distinction to make.
So, what are the domestic consequences of U.S. based companies offshoring instead of hiring domestically? Well, when it comes to the U.S. tech worker, it seems that computing jobs are getting scarcer for them . PRB found that “about 30 million jobs” in the United States are vulnerable to offshoring, with Computer programmers being the occupation most vulnerable to offshoring. For companies, this is exciting news, as they are paying tens of thousands of dollars less for work overseas, but domestic tech workers are now seeing less and less jobs. Is this an outcome that should be ethically acceptable for companies? When viewing their employees simply as the means to an end, it seems logical that they would choose those who will do the same work for cheaper. However, should this be acceptable? As the choices for domestic tech workers go down, and jobs become harder and harder to find, they will have less mobility within their field and less career opportunities.
To try and find a solution, we can use some preexisting ethical guidelines, specifically those defined by John Rawls. John Rawls expands upon social contract theory, with a foundation that has “an emphasis on liberties(negative rights)”. He focuses on a set of moral rules that allows for cooperation and adherence to said rules that people from different backgrounds will follow. Making sure that every citizen within this society would exercise all their rights was also an important part of his ideology, as he believed that the ability to disagree was possessed by “people of good faith”. Fairness is a concept that he touts supremely, and while the “practical consequences of this very specific political policy are hotly debated”,  he essentially claims that this concept of fairness must be applied to all of the members of this society so that they can exercise their rights equally . A tool that Rawls introduced is something called “the veil of ignorance” which will help determine “the proper principles or policies of a just social or political system”. This veil of ignorance states that the person who is “behind the veil” doesn’t know “his or her gender, age, race, talents, wealth”, so that social and ethical decisions, as well as political policies, can be made without bias relating to the above factors. This demonstrates part of Rawls’ idea of fairness in a society.
The veil of ignorance idea can be applied to the ethical questions regarding offshoring because it will negate the problem we’ve been facing. Instead of deciding to hire someone based on their cheaper price due to geographic location, an employer acting from behind the veil of ignorance will hire the most qualified person for the job, whoever that may be. This is obviously not a perfect solution, as implementing the veil of ignorance practically is not an easy task to accomplish. Additionally, the veil of ignorance sets a hard to reach standard, as getting people who are completely ignorant of the surrounding situation would be quite difficult in the real world. Despite these challenges, I believe that implementing something like the veil of ignorance in the computing industry, specifically in regard to hiring practices, would be extremely beneficial. An implementation of this could be preventing the names, backgrounds, and ethnicities of applicants from showing up on résumés, which would force the employer to review only the credentials and experience of the applicants, eliminating most preconceptions one might have about the applicants. I think this analysis of Rawls’ ideas would be beneficial to employers that genuinely want to improve their hiring practices and push themselves to uphold an ethical standard of treating all employees and applicants fairly and not letting preconceptions influence decisions about hiring them.
In conclusion, the computing industry’s expanding landscape and increasing number of offshoring being done by domestic companies deserves a clear look to find what the ethical implications of such a practice has on the industry. After exploring the viewpoints of tech workers impacted by offshoring, as well as exploring John Rawls’ social contract philosophy, primarily the veil of ignorance, we can see a potential solution to the ethical consequences of offshoring. Even though it is far from a perfect solution in the real world, by utilizing the veil of ignorance, ethical integrity can be maintained, and candidates can be chosen by an employer based solely on the qualifications listed on their application, instead of potentially influencing employers’ decisions based on geographic or demographic information.",,1186

9/15/20","Ethics are extremely important to consider in all parts of our lives. Ethics are defined as the “moral principles that govern a person’s behavior or the conducting of an activity” by Oxford Languages. In the world of computing where work is increasingly moving online there are many ethical dilemmas that arise. One of these dilemmas that many Americans might be able to relate to is the outsourcing of jobs, in this instance computing jobs, to countries such as India. It is common knowledge that corporations want to maximize profit and that many skilled workers around the world need jobs and sources of income. This decision many U.S. companies are having to make is whether to hire workers from home where things like wages and benefits are highly regulated and expensive, or overseas where there is less regulation and the wages and benefits are allowed to be much lower for the workers.
There are many things to consider when thinking about what the most ethical decision is that these companies can make. Luckily, there have been many great philosophers over time that have contemplated ethical decisions such as this for many years of their lives. One of these philosophers whose ideas and findings are still spoken about even years after his death is John Rawls. One very interesting idea that Rawls spoke about was “Justice as Fairness”. If we apply just this one of Rawls’ many ideas to the dilemma of whether U.S. companies should be hiring U.S. versus Indian programmers, we should be able to gain a better look into this situation and help to decide what is the ethical choice and what is not.
To think about this through a different perspective, we will consider John Rawls’ “two principles of justice as fairness”. These two principles are as follows. The first principle is that “Each person has the same indefeasible claim to a fully adequate scheme of equal basic liberties” [1]. I am sure many people in the democratic world would defend this principle as our society in the U.S. strives towards this idea. The second principle says that social and economic inequalities must satisfy two conditions: “They are to be attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity”, and also that “They are to be to the greatest benefit of the least-advantaged members of society” [2]. These two principles will prove useful as we discuss our programmer job dilemma. Now, these principles seem to apply to the rules of one single society and do not discuss how two very different countries should interact, however these rules give us a good idea as to what is important to consider.
It is easy to get confused with what is the ethical decision versus what saves more costs for the company. However, applying these two principles of justice that Rawls has thought of makes our scope more manageable and accurate. For this purpose, we can interpret the first principle as the basic liberties that are available to the U.S. programmer should compare to what is offered to the Indian programmer. For instance, certain things to think about here include whether healthcare will be provided or not, or maybe if workers will be able to negotiate their pay. Whatever things such as these that are offered for the U.S. programmer should also be offered to the Indian programmer if we loosely apply this first principle to our dilemma.
Principle 2 would require these programming jobs be available to both the American programmers and the Indian programmers at a fair equality of opportunity. This could manifest as an application process that is international and does not discriminate based on where the applicant is coming from. It is also important how you define what an economic or a social inequality is. If an American programmer and an Indian programmer have access to the same job, but the Indian programmer gets paid less, you could say there is an economic inequality between the two. This first principle might force us to give both groups the same opportunity to the same pay, which would defeat the whole cost-saving purpose of this outsourcing and there wouldn’t be much reason for the company to hire the Indian programmers. For this instance, it might make the most sense to think about the compensation as a comparison to what the workers would expect to get paid in their own country and not the workers in comparison to each other. If both workers in each country are offered a job at the same income level in relation to their own country, it should be ethical according to the first part of principle 2.
The second part of principle 2 might make it a lot easier for the company to come to a decision. Once again, this part says that any social or economic inequalities must benefit the least advantaged member. To apply this principle to our dilemma it only makes sense to interpret this literally as in the benefit to each group of people. It is hard to define the least advantaged group in this situation with there being both the U.S. and Indian programmer. One thing to consider is that if the U.S. worker is being disadvantaged by having a job once available to them in their own country be sent overseas. This could eventually cause a reduction in the amount of jobs and opportunities available to the U.S. worker, putting them at a disadvantage in comparison to the Indian worker who is able to apply for these new jobs that are being outsourced. One question that should be asked is whether the Indian worker is disadvantaged by being provided a job where they would be making significantly less than a U.S. worker doing the same work. For our purposes we can say there is a disadvantage for both parties with both choices, so we can focus more on the first part of principle 2. Applying this 2nd principle, the most ethical decision to make would be to offer the programming job to both people in the U.S. and in India, and offering both positions the same liberties while compensating what one would expect to make for the position in their residing country.
Before this analysis, it was easy to jump to the conclusion that the U.S. programmers should keep their jobs, coming from the perspective of a citizen of the U.S. who wants its citizens to have jobs provided for them. From the perspective of the company trying to save money it would be a no-brainer to hire the similarly skilled worker from India for much less compensation. However, according to Rawls’ idea of his two principles of justice as fairness, it seems as according to the 1st principle that Rawls would want there to be equal opportunities for the job to be filled by both the programmer from the U.S. and the programmer from India. According to the 2nd principle and how we interpreted it the same liberties should be offered to the hires from either country. This includes liberties such as negotiating pay and sick leave, or any others that would be provided to the American worker. These principles don’t straight up tell us much as to whether it is ethical or not to pay the Indian worker less however after the analysis it seems like as long as each worker is paid fair compensation that would be accepted in each country it will be ethical. This determination would be helpful to any company faced with the dilemma of whether it is ethical to offshore a job or not.
In conclusion, the most ethical change this company can make is to open the application process to people from both countries, and to provide programmers from both countries with the same liberties as each other. While there is nothing stopping the company from still preferring to hire the lower paid worker from India, there should be equal opportunity at getting the job provided to each worker according to Rawls’ principles.","References

Page 1","In the industry of computing, ethics play a very important role. Without taking ethics into consideration, the computing industry would be rife with poor business practices. Malicious practices such as phishing, data harvesting, and spying via spyware would run rampant in an industry that disregards ethics and regulation, especially since software may be distributed rapidly with ease. However, these are just the technical aspects of ethics in the computing industry. In this paper, I will discuss the lesser-known normative ethics behind the computing industry. To be more specific, I will answer the question posed by whether to hire United States based programmers or offshore programmers located in India. By drawing on the ideas of philosophers such as John Rawls, I will defend my decision of hiring foreign Indian programmers.
Currently, the modern computing industry is expanding at an extremely high growth rate. The tech industry leads the way for the U.S. stock market and is seeing tremendous growth during this pandemic. Society is becoming increasingly dependent on technology; we carry iPhones that have literal millions of times more processing power than the computers that sent the Apollo Spacecraft to the moon. These iPhones are all produced primarily in East Asia [1]. Why are they not produced in the United States since Apple is headquartered there? The answer is simple from a financial standpoint; it is cheaper and more efficient to offshore production to East Asian countries, boosting company profits. This is a highly discussed point when discussing the ethics surrounding this dilemma. This argument from the other side (people for hiring U.S. based programmers) also ties into my stance on hiring Indian programmers as opposed to local American programmers. While it is true that it is cheaper to hire Indian programmers, I would argue it is offset by the fact that local purchasing power in the United States is 115.58% higher than in India [2]. I do not believe in the argument that hiring Indian programmers is unethical in this sense.
Ignoring the financial aspects of this discussion, I still believe hiring Indian programmers is a valid choice. One could argue that since the software company is based in the U.S., you must hire U.S. programmers, even if you must pay them more for the same result. This is in part due to the concept of allegiance to your home country. However, if we were to eliminate the concept of borders in the world and view humanity as one, what difference does it make? An Indian programmer who is just as capable as an American programmer, if not more, should be a valid candidate for the job. Just because the Indian programmer is not located in your home country does not disqualify them from the task at hand.
John Rawls has a strong requirement for claim rights (positive rights) in his system of justice [3]. As per the definition of claim rights, both I and the Indian programmers have sufficient means to make effective use of our freedoms. As the manager of the software company, I have the freedom to hire whomever I deem capable enough to perform the task at hand of developing my software. The Indian programmers have the freedom and ability to offer
their services, albeit at a lower price than their American counterparts, however they see fit. I am not forcing anyone against their will to code my software; in other words, the Indian programmers’ negative rights, or liberties, are not being infringed upon. I am simply offering a job to the best qualified candidate that can offer me the most value efficiently. It is up to me as the company manager to decide whether the lower cost is justified in the quality of work being delivered.
One argument against hiring Indian programmers is the working conditions these programmers are subject to. India does not offer the same government mandated standards of working conditions that are present in the United States [4]. In a workspace consisting of hundreds, if not thousands, of computers that generate immense heat as a secondary output, it would be inhumane to not have air conditioning. This is the sad reality of life for some. As the manager of the software company, I would personally vet the working conditions of the Indian programmers I would potentially hire. I would absolutely refuse to hire programmers from a company that does not treat their employees in a humane fashion. In an ideal world, a company that violates these standards would quickly lose business, close, or be forced to improve working conditions if software companies looking to hire programmers followed suit in demanding ethical working conditions for all their employees. However, this is not the case in today’s world. My decision to not hire programmers from a company that does not offer ethical working conditions may not make a difference because another software company with a smaller moral/ethical compass may hire the Indian programming company. Even then, I refute the argument that hiring Indian programmers is unethical due to the working conditions that some, not all, are subject to.
Another argument against hiring Indian programmers is focused around the “problem” of offshoring. Many believe that offshoring simply provides pure benefit to the hiring company who is now receiving the same quality of work for significantly lower prices. However, this is not the case. There are many downsides to offshoring such as communication breakdown, coordination breakdown, control breakdown, cohesion barriers, and culture clash [5]. Ethically, we can see that offshoring is not just a guaranteed beneficial solution for a company that is also preferred because it is cheaper. We are offering a job to a worker located anywhere in the world that is capable of performing the required task. The fact of the matter is that offshoring creates numerous opportunities for hardworking, skilled laborers living in poverty to progress outwards [6].
I believe it would be American ignorance to think foreign laborers do not deserve a chance of working at an American based company simply because of its geographical location on a planet that we all share as humans. In regard to game theory applied to the world of business ethics, game theory states just because your company will not do something does not mean another company will not [7]. However, it is up to you to decide to go about the morally just  and
ethically “right” option as opposed to the option that benefits you and your shareholders the most, who would be considered the advantaged group vs. the disadvantaged group of employees [8]. At the end of the day, we are all the same organisms sharing a singular home, regardless of our skin color or other demographics.","References

ICSI 300Z - Societal Ethical Implications
9/15/2020","The ethic in focus was the hiring foreign programmer, specifically Indian programmers. Problem was the cheap cost of hiring Indian programmer causes many to worry about less jobs and wages in the programming field. If this problem were to go unsolved, less people would want a job in programming. In the future, there will be less programmer and companies will face huge competition and demand will rise. Then more people decide to take this field, however information on how to become one will be scarce. In the general view, science and technological advancement will stagger.
There are many ethical points of view to this problem. If wages were raised to the average of where the country that the companies were located, it will be a loss to Indian programmer since it’s their right to choose their wage, which result them to have higher hiring rate. Another viewpoint was “comparing the pay to the average salary in each country or by comparing the number of other job opportunities available [3].” This favors the Indian Programmer since they had low average salary and less job opportunity in their country. To solve this dilemma, the help of a modern philosopher is needed. In focus, John Rawls’ ideas will be the one discussed.
Veil of ignorance is where one “does not know his or her gender, age, race, talents, wealth [3].” People will likely find maximum happiness without intruding others’ happiness. As an example, “If they decide that 10% of the population will be slaves to the others, they cannot be surprised if they find themselves to be slaves [1].”Therefore, not many people would risk putting themselves in a bad situation. This will also prevent any disadvantage or least advantage group in worst situation than before. There are some things that those who are veiled knows. One of them was “That the society is under conditions of moderate scarcity: there is enough to go around, but not enough for everyone to get what they want [2].” This means the veiled will pick the most optimal solution that will work for everyone, but not everyone gets what they wanted.
After applying the veil to solve this problem, the veiled programmers must face the possibility that they are born in India, where the average wages are low, cause by the lack of job. To maximize their happiness, they should be allowed to find jobs in other places with higher chance of being hired. In the shoe of American programmer, companies will be less likely to hire them since it is cheaper to hire Indian programmer. It will be better if the chance of recruitment be equal. While maximizing happiness, one cannot interfere with others’ happiness. Without interfering with other happiness, they all should be given an equal chance of recruitment.
Before John Rawl’s idea, veil of ignorance, the utilitarian approach was used. Basically, greatest happiness for the greater number, where it is fine if majority are happy. In this situation, hiring Indian programmer will be the right choice. Employer will be happy with the decrease in cost. Customers gets to buy product at a cheaper price. Also, Indian programmer gets to keep their job without worrying about jobless. Meanwhile, only American programmer be satisfied if they get hired. Before the analyze, a simple way to fix this problem was adding more job opportunity. It will benefit both programmers, while a loss for the company. All in all, this paper is useful for those learning about ethics for industry computing. It could also be use for those who want to learn about John Rawl’s idea, veil of ignorance.
In conclusion, using veil of ignorance, all programmers should get an equal chance of being hired. Foreign programmer should be allowed to work in U.S.A since it will benefit many people, like the customers and the company. This would not be what Indian programmer want, but it will get them more job opportunities.","Bibliography

Assignment 1. Normative Ethics","Today's U.S. workplace culture is diverse, and computing in particular tends to be a culturally and linguistically diverse industry. As demonstrated by the frequency of American companies hiring programmers from other cultures and ethnic backgrounds, it is highly likely that workers and managers in today’s computing workplaces will need clear policies for managing those differences. Clearly, workers must be able to cooperate functionally, coming together despite their differences; however, those differences also cannot be judged.
American culture is rich, diverse, and is becoming more accepting and inclusive which should be a hallmark of our nation. As our country has worked to separate itself from its history of racism and prejudice, much has changed.  In a country where discrimination was once legal, much progress has been made toward ensuring that acceptance is the standard, and exclusion based on race, gender, sexual orientation, culture, and socioeconomic status is deemed unjust. This sense of open-mindedness and tolerance is visible in many places in our nation, and today’s American businesses thrive because of the diversity such acculturation brings to professional workplaces.  Moreover, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits workplace discrimination based on religion, national origin, race, color, or sexual orientation and today’s companies implement policies to ensure that these laws are upheld.
However, one of the less obvious ways in which employers and professionals still tend to discriminate against their peers in business settings is by assigning bias to non-native speakers’ language and accents.  As workplaces are becoming more and more diverse, it is almost inevitable that professionals from different language backgrounds encounter one another. And whether the bias that people have is worker-to-worker or employer-to-employee, and whether it is intentional prejudice or subconscious bias, dialect perception in professional, business-oriented settings like computing workplaces has become a significant issue.
The three most fundamental focal points that Rawls finds in the public political culture of a democratic society are that citizens are free and equal, and that society should be a fair system of cooperation. Consider culture in workplaces, and the variety of subcultures that must work together under a democratic structure, it is important that any workplace is governed by such a “fair system” of cooperation (Freeman 4).
New York Times writer Raymond Hernandez wrote an article that directly addresses the hostility and ridicule that workers face because of their non-native language and accents.  He cites comments and experiences from non-native speakers who have endured this kind of bias and condescending attitude from peers and authority figures. The article points to a reality in which this kind of ethnic and racial bias forces non-native speakers to have to choose between being seen as professionally equal to native speakers (by forcing themselves to work to eliminate their accents or other cultural markers), or enduring bias (Hernandez 3). One non-native speaker Hernandez interviewed reported being fearful of talking aloud in the work environment because his peers would mock him (Hernandez 2).  Because of the “ridicule, condescension or hostility” many non-native speakers face in their professional workplaces, many “go to great lengths to reduce their accents and speak like natives, often seeking speech therapists and tutors for help” (Hernandez 2). Some feel this is the only way to ensure equitable treatment in the workplace. In his 2016 study, Gazi Islam researched the bias and stigma associated with non-native language barriers and accents in today’s professional business workplaces, specifically at the emotional toll of this discrimination on the speaker/employee.  Many of the study’s subjects reported feeling undervalued (their opinions and contributions are considered less because they speak with accents), being left out of important communication opportunities and often ended up having “worse interpersonal and trust relationships” in the business workplace. The study also revealed that employers tend to have lower expectations for workers with non-native accents.
Once we recognize the pervasiveness of accent bias and how easy it is to fall into a discrimination trap when we don’t even mean to, we need to start encouraging American professional workplaces to take steps to ensure that fairness and equality are guaranteed for all. Moreover, diversity in general “leads to more viewpoints and more ideas, which results in better products and services” (Williams).
Rawls’ principles demonstrate that it is the responsibility of the managers and other authority figures to enforce a reasonable, pluralistic work culture and establish and maintain a sense of tolerance for all cultures, religions and languages. Rawls believed that applying utilitarianism in a workplace and treating that social culture with the idea that policies should be constructed to allow for the “greatest good of the greatest number” fails to appreciate diversity.  Since American workplaces, including computing workplaces, are culturally and ethnically diverse, and since language complexities arise with that kind of diversity, it becomes more important than ever for computing managers to avoid utilitarian models and policies because they “adopt[s] for society as a whole the principle of choice for one man.” And, when companies do this, they fail to “take seriously the distinction between persons” including language differences (Richardson 2). This is how workers become undervalued, repressed and unfairly judged. The work environment that results is not productive, will not result in strong profits and, above all else, is not providing a society where its citizens are free and equal, or working in a fair system of cooperation.
Rawls encourages the concept of “reasonable citizens” (Wenar 3) which seems to have tremendous application to a fair computing workplace. Reasonable citizens, says Rawls, want to live in a society “in which they can cooperate with their fellow citizens on terms that are acceptable to all (Wenar 3). This concept of the reasonable citizen is one that must be encouraged in computing workplaces.  Cooperation is critical in the industry of computing. So how do managers create reasonable citizens in a diverse workplace? How do they create policies that guide their workers to “willing to propose and abide by mutually acceptable rules” even when language and accent challenges can make such collaboration more difficult (Wenar 3)?
One critical goal would be to avoid a utilitarian approach to policy-making.  Managers cannot adopt a majority focus when creating the structures that dictate how workers can relate to one another.  Policies must be clear, in place and consistently enforced when it comes to issues of language and accent bias.  Rawls states that reasonable citizens will behave appropriately when “given the assurance that others will also do so” (Wenar 3). And if this culture is maintained throughout the computing workplace, the rules will be honored, even when this means an individual must sacrifice their own particular interests in a specific situation. Hopefully such a work culture will encourage workers to work around potential problems, rather than be halted by them or react negatively, because Rawls saw the importance of “reasonable citizens” who want to live in a society in which they can “cooperate with their fellow citizens on terms that are acceptable to all” (Wenar 3). It would seem wise to encourage workers in a computing workplace to be reasonable citizens who seek to cooperate with their fellow citizens. Rawls states that reasonable citizens are “willing to propose and abide by mutually acceptable rules, given the assurance that others will also do so” which means that it is critical that an office or other work environment establish clear rules for interacting and cooperating, despite individual differences. (Wenar 3).  If the ideals of reasonable citizens are encouraged in a workplace, workers will adhere to the rules that honor everyone, allowing for a focus on collaboration and cooperation, “even when this means sacrificing their own particular interests” (Wenar 3). However, it is the responsibility of the managers of any computing office to use their “political power” appropriately and fairly, to govern the interactions of their workers and programmers fairly and equally (Wenar 3).
Today’s computing workplace managers can progress toward minimizing conscious and subconscious workplace bias by taking intentional, clear steps in our professional environments.  First, they must recognize that creating a diverse workplace will help expose all speakers and listeners to a variety of languages and will automatically reduce the brain’s subconscious reaction to processing the unfamiliar -- because accents will become more familiar and therefore less problematic. Additionally, employees should be educated to understand that their brain is learning to process the non-native accent and that they need to be patient and open to that learning process which will help them become responsible citizens of their workplace society. Therefore, workplaces need to be provided with training to promote strategies, and toolkits for effective communication style for the workplaces between citizens with different backgrounds, languages and accents. The aim is to create inclusive workplaces and look beyond prejudices, and also to understand that there will be consequences for failing to participate in these positive types of interactions.
Ultimately, Rawls envisioned a culture where every citizen could achieve what he referred to as the “primary goods:” rights, liberties, and opportunities; income and wealth; and the social bases of self-respect (Richardson 2). Clearly a fair computing workplace should ensure that all workers have the same opportunities for work, promotion, income and respect, regardless of their native language or related accent.  Every worker, regardless of his native language or challenges posed by his native accent, should feel respected and free in his workplace culture.","Works Cited

Societal and Ethical Implications of Computer Science
September 10th, 2020","The long-standing issue of hiring foreign workers does not possess any simple answers but has rather sparked word wide debate. When applied to this issue of deciding to hire American or Indian programmers, the most ethical solution to this controversy is to disregard the country of origin for workers, and hire based solely upon skill, experience, etc., namely any aspect that contributes toward one’s ability to complete a job. In doing so, one is making a decision with a veil of ignorance, which disregards ones race, gender, or creed[3] – a theory proposed by John Rawls - which in turn is the most ethical way to come to a decision, since it is the most objective. This practice is the most utilitarian option, as it will give companies a deserving and effective staff, while also granting opportunity to those who deserve it the most. It is important to always take ethics into consideration regarding any major decision, especially those that affect others, and more specifically in the world of computer science. The systems and services produced in this field are widely used by individuals and consumers on both small and large scales. If companies abandon their ethics and morality, then they are no longer serving the public. In such a large and continually growing field, the implications of ethics have a very large and very real impact on people’s everyday lives and can affect the way in which they interact with the commodities produced. There are those who can argue that the ethical way to approach this problem is to hire those who need help, for example - hiring people from countries with less favorable conditions that will have better opportunities if they are hired in a foreign country. Another idea that has been proffered is the idea that companies should hire those who are willing to work for the lowest salary. A third counter-option that can be proposed stems from the pro-American sentiment that is common in the United States, which contains the idea that American companies should hire American workers above outsourcing no matter what, and that is the most ethical choice – since it includes protecting your own citizens. However, this idea is inherently biased and therefore, by definition, can not be the most ethical choice.
In hiring workers with a “veil of ignorance [3]”, one can ensure the best outcome for all parties involved. In doing so, the employer can decide without any “bargaining” [3] from those involved and can make a purely just and abstract choice. In disassociating from the more personal identity of a person, a clearer and fairer candidate can receive the job, because it will be strictly merit based. Hiring those most deserving not only justly affects the candidates but selecting someone based on skill and experience can have a better outcome for the company that has allowed this person to join their team. More experienced workers bring leadership and are effective parts of workforce, as they know what they are doing, and are the most well-fit for the job/task at hand [4]. Also, requiring skill and experience over cheap labor force will encourage people to work harder and attain better versions of themselves. Since this choice has the most benefits for the people involved, it is the utilitarian approach, and in turn is the most ethical option when forced to go down this path.
Another proposed solution to the moral dilemma posed by the issue of whether to hire a foreign worker is to hire based upon who would be given the better opportunity. This option directly violates the ideas of Rawls since it takes someone’s personal circumstances into account [2]. By taking other factors into consideration such as living/working conditions and ethnicity, you are no longer operating morally since you are allowing your judgement to be clouded, and are not giving everyone a just opportunity at the job being offered [3]. It can be argued that if someone else is going to have to be subjected to poor conditions in their home country, then the employer has a moral obligation to hire them to give them a better life [1]. However, this cannot be the ethical choice since it is not the best interest for potentially better employees who are born in America. Also, this does not always prove to be the best option for the company, since they may be passing up on more qualified workers, and in turn produce lower-quality product and services.
A second theory on how to manage this ethical problem is to choose the candidate who is willing to take the lowest salary, typically foreign workers, since this would be favorable to the company since they will not have to pay as much for the worker [1]. This option also violates Rawls’ theory though, since each candidate is supposed to seem “rationally and mutually disinterested [3],” and by offering to take lower salaries the candidates are not doing so. This in turn means that any decision the company makes about who to hire is inherently unethical. Also, this option does not take the workers’ best interests into consideration, as those who are more qualified could easily be passed up for the job since their better skill and experience call for higher wages.
Another idea that has been deemed an ethical option is founded on the concept of pro-American sentiment [5], which believes that American companies should never outsource, for any reason, and instead has a moral obligation hire American citizens. This theory again violates Rawls idea of the “veil of ignorance [3]” because it takes ethnicity into account, which makes any decision made unjust and in violation of ethics.  This does typically improve company relations with the public, which is good for them, but it does not hold the best interest of those applying for the job since more able-bodied people may not be given the opportunity simply because they weren’t born in America. This can also be seen as a negative for the companies since they are ignoring an entire job pool, which may have far better workers, and therefore the company is not operating more effectively and may not be producing as quality services as they potentially could be if they hired certain foreign workers.
The proposed idea of hiring based on ability alone is in compliance with the theory of utilitarianism, which deems the most ethical choice to be the one that does the most good for the most amount of people. After researching and evaluating the theories on justice and ethics of Rawls, and more specifically his idea of a “veil of ignorance,” it is apparent that this solution is also the most ethical choice when held to that standard. Companies can review these findings and use them to make an educated decision on which path to follow when faced with the difficult decision of choosing between hiring foreign or domestic workers, and can use this analysis to come to an ethical decision.  Also, the public, and more specifically those who are applying to jobs, can use this research before they judge a company based on a decision they have made or how they chose to approach this problem in determining whether or not the company has behaved ethically, and with the best interests in mind.","References

ICSI300Z – Societal and Ethical Implications of Computing
September 14th, 2020","In the computer science industry, I believe that keeping our ethics in check and on our minds at all times is extremely important. As the world around us only becomes more and more technologically oriented, being technologically literate is a more powerful and important skill than ever before, and that wont be changing any time soon. As programmers, we are the people who have the power to create and mold the future around us, be that in AI, software, or any other field of the industry. To quote Uncle Ben from Spider-Man: “With great power comes great responsibility.” And I believe that this quote can be applied to many situations in the world around us, but also fits very well with the topic of this assignment. As programmers we should be questioning whether or not we should before we question whether or not we could. With this in mind, the key question of this assignment is to apply the ideas of ethics to the question of hiring American vs Indian programmers. Suppose you are a manager at a software company that is preparing to work on a large software project. To complete this project, you will need to hire dozens of programmers. Thanks to the internet, you have the ability to hire foreign programmers whose labor is cheaper than the domestic programmers that are available for the position. Is it ethical to hire cheaper labor?
One view on this subject may be the fact that it is simply the most optimal choice for the company is to hire the foreign programmers as it saves money, and maximizing profits is the job of a company. However, I disagree with this sentiment for three reasons. If you have a utilitarianist view on the world, while hiring the Indian programmers may seem the most optimal as it saves the company money, it leaves all three other parties involved in either a worse off position than they were before, or in the same spot and certainly does not produce the most amount of happiness for them all. For starters, I believe if a company were to hire the cheaper foreign labor, it is actually hurting the foreign programmers more than it would help them. I feel this way because by hiring Indian programmers and paying them less than their American counterparts, you are only perpetuating the status quo of the pay gap in the industry and all this will do is continue to hold them in the place that they are in. A study that was conducted in 2008 showed that American programmers make about $71,000 more than Indian programmers make. As philosopher John Rawls stated: “an action or social or political structure is not ethical if it has the effect of leaving the least advantaged people worse off than they were before.” By continuing to hire these Indian programmers at a lower rate, you are not helping them close the gap at all. If you are going to hire foreign, they should be paid the same amount as the programmers who are domestic.
Next, the American programmer also obviously loses in this situation as the job position they were vying for was given to someone else. Obviously I am biased, being an American who hopes to one day be a software programmer, however I can not imagine it would feel great knowing that you went through the immense amount of work and time it takes to become an adept programmer, now looking to find work and you can’t find it because the jobs are being given to other people for a reason completely out of your control – you cost more than they do for no reason other than where you live. I think that if you are going to hire a programmer, the person should be hired for being the one who fits the job and the company environment the best, not someone who is cheaper, especially not by upwards of $70,000 that only further divides the pay inequality in the computer science industry.
Furthermore, there is another group of people that is affected by and loses in this situation if the Indian programmers are hired – the consumer. Considering the fact that the Indian programmers are likely working in far worse conditions than an American programmer is, their work may suffer from this too. It is not unlikely that the company would be pushing out an inferior product due to their choices of exploiting cheaper labor in this way. If the software company truly wants their project to succeed, they should be putting the best energy forward to ensure that the best and most motivated people are working on the project, not only for the sake of the company’s success but the consumer as well. The consumer does not deserve an inferior product, especially not one born out of this type of exploitation.
Before analyzing this issue for the assignment, I already had held this opinion but now only feel stronger in the way that I felt. I always felt that exploitation of cheap labor overseas in underprivileged nations was morally wrong, but now that I have put it under the lens of something that directly affects me it is only more clear to me what is right. Reading the 2008 study that showed American programmers make $70,000 more than Indian programmers was quite a big shock to say the least, I knew the pay gap was there but I never expected it to be that large. I think that if change were to be made to fix this massive pay inequality, it really would not be too hard. Either pay the Indian programmers the same as their American counterparts, or just hire whoever fits the job best and pay accordingly based on whatever the tasks at hand are. The whole reason that this question of ethics even exists is because the companies have become too comfortable exploiting the disadvantaged for so long that it has become what is the norm.
In conclusion, as computer scientists / programmers, I feel we have a responsibility to hold up our morals and ethics as the skills that we hold in our technological literacy are and will only continue to be extremely important as we get deeper into the future. When beginning a software project, you will obviously need to hire programmers to complete the tasks for you, and while from the perspective of the manager it is understandable that you need to maximize the profits of your company, that isn’t an excuse for exploiting people who are disadvantaged in my opinion. On the topic of whether or not American or Indian programmers should be hired based on how much their labor costs, I feel like it should not even be part of the conversation. Ideally, whoever fits the job best would be the one that ends up being hired, otherwise everybody involved except the people at the top lose. The Indian programmers in question continue to be held down under a ‘glass ceiling’ so to speak being constantly paid less. The American programmers are losing out on potential jobs due to something completely out of their own control, and the consumer is most likely receiving an inferior product.","Works Cited

Hiring Foreign Workers: Pros and Cons","Many developed and developing countries are experiencing growing levels of foreign worker hiring to sustain the economy and productivity. The practice of hiring foreign workers is a solution to local shortage of skilled labors or workforces. While hiring foreign workers offer some benefits, there are also associated disadvantages. In this article, the pros and cons of hiring foreign workers are discussed.
According to Rawls, it is the most vulnerable group that receives the most attention in the social or political structure. If a policy makes the most vulnerable people worse than before, then the policy is unethical. Rawls also proposed that people should abide by the spirit of the contract, and once they have confirmed the contract, they should perform it, no matter how difficult they may encounter, otherwise it will be a big trouble for others. For example, at work, if we sign a contract with the company, what we should do is how to use our talents better instead of complaining about the company’s bad things every day and thinking about changing jobs.
Labor cost is an obvious reason why many companies prefer to employ foreign workers instead of the local labors. Developed countries have greater job opportunities their developing counter-parts. Foreign workers from the developing countries are attracted by the greater job opportunities abroad and willing to accept lower salaries for the jobs which, otherwise, requires higher salaries to hire the local employee. S. Baase and T. Henry (2019) discuss the ethical views of hiring the Indian programmers, by paying them less than the U.S. programmers. S. Baase and T. Henry (2019) argue that buyers can pay less while sells want to get higher prices and therefore, there is no ethical issue about choosing the cheaper of employees.
Another motivation of hiring foreign workers is due to the lack of skilled labors. As the economy grows, some developed countries are lacking of skilled labors.  Therefore, hiring foreign workers present a good opportunities to bring the experienced and skilled individuals to bridge the gap. S.-E. Khoo, C. Voigt-Graf, P. Mcdonald, and G. Hugo (2007) discuss the motivation behind an increasing demand for skilled labors in Australia. The authors point out that with the internationalization of the economy, Australia is in shortage of people with specialized skills and knowledge. Therefore, hiring foreign skilled workers can effectively manage Australia’s migration and labor trends.
Hiring foreign workers is viewed as a solution to aging population. Many developed countries are experiencing low birth rate while the better health care allows their citizens to live longer as well. This creates demographical imbalance and puts burden on social care, tax revenues and government spending. By hiring foreign workers, shortages in health care and social care can be filled with young workers. According to L. L. Thang (2011), Singapore had the lowest total fertility at 1.22 among the resident population in 2009 and this led to the necessity of an expanding foreign workforce. In the same year, foreign workers represented 35.2% of total employment.
In developed countries, certain undesirable jobs are difficult to fill by local labors. The undesirable jobs are usually associated with low-skilled jobs. Hiring foreign workers provides a benefit to business owners who rely on flexible labor to fill job vacancies. J. S. Lee (2002) discusses about Taiwan’s foreign labor policy as a solution to the shortage of low-skilled. As the Taiwan’s economy grew, there was significant shortage of labors in construction, labor-intensive industries and 3D jobs (dirty, dangerous and difficult) of which the native workers are afraid.
Hiring foreign workers can, however, have adverse effects. One of the impacts is the downward pressure on wages, especially for the low-paid and low-skilled labor segment. As employers have option to hire low-cost foreign workers, there is a little incentive to raise wages for local employees for the same jobs.  S. Baase and T. Henry (2019) mention that most potential foreign workers accept any amount which is less the standard pay. Therefore, some countries have to enact relevant law to force employers to equally pay the workers who perform similar tasks.
Another significant impact of hiring foreign workers is the structural employment, especially for the low-paid and low-skilled labor segment. The local workers find it hard to compete foreign workers since foreign workers are willing to accept lower wages than their local counter-parts. Therefore, local low-skilled workers find it difficult to get into higher-skilled occupations. According to H. S. , Alhamad (2014), 30% of Saudi Arabia's population of 27.3 million are foreign workers and remittances from foreign labor  represents almost 6.2% of the GDP. However, the level of unemployment among local Saudis is remarkably high due to fierce competition from low-paid foreign workers. High unemployment among local Saudis forces the government to deport as much as 20% of foreign labors and regulate the competition between local and foreign labors.
While foreign workers contribute to tax revenue, there exists unprecedented pressure on public services such schools, hospitals, roads and public transport. With influx of foreign workers, the population is growing faster than expected, this can cause deterioration in the quality of public amenities. L. Low (1989) discusses the social costs of foreign labor on Singapore society which includes medical, housing, transport, training and other recreational amenities. The author also refers higher crime rates associated with low-income migrant workers. Another issue , as mentioned by L. Low (1989),  is unapproved marriages between foreign workers and local, which leads to naturalised citizenships and births by default.
In conclusion, practice of hiring foreign workers presents several advantages at both private and governmental level. However, these advantages are countered by the adverse effects brought by. Therefore, regulations and laws are required to control and manage the associated problems.","References

As humans, they need ethics to guide them and their contributions to the industry. Many times, the computing industry focuses too much on profit or the need to constantly outdo what others have done. Eventually there is a point where ‘just because you can, it doesn’t mean you should,’ and by using ethics, workers can try to define that point. An issue where ethics, specifically John Rawls’ ideas, can be applied is whether to hire foreign or domestic workers. The ideas of John Rawls view offshoring as unethical, because it values economic profit over the quality of life of citizens and consumers in the country the business is based in.
Those against hiring foreign workers say it exploits them because they are paid less than their equivalents from the United States. This can then in turn disadvantage American workers because they aren’t hired just for the fact that foreign workers are paid less, which leads to lower costs [1]. Those against hiring foreign workers also see how foreign workers aren’t working in pleasant conditions and don’t receive benefits comparable to what workers from the United States have, which they view as unfair. Those who support hiring foreign workers believe that even if foreign workers are paid less, it is still ethical. This is because the end product will end up costing less due to less costs for labor, which will benefit the consumer. There is also an argument that paying Indian workers higher than their home country’s standard can yield better results. This is because “paying more than expected might get you higher morale, better productivity, and increased company loyalty” [1]. When looking at hiring foreign workers from an ethical perspective, we can apply John Rawls’s ideas.
John Rawls’s philosophies involve the arrangement of institutions, such as the family and government. He calls this arrangement the basic structure, which determines “who will receive social recognition, who will have which basic rights, who will have opportunities to get what kind of work, what the distribution of income and wealth will be, and so on” [2]. This in turn highly affects the quality of life of its citizens. Rawls believes these institutions need to help the disadvantaged, meaning any policy made needs to yield the best results for the least advantaged. Also, the institutions can’t trade off basic rights and liberties with other social goods, which includes economic growth [2]. Using Rawls’s philosophies, hiring foreign workers would be unethical, because it is usually done for economic gain, and it disadvantages the workers in the country the business is based in. In the case of offshoring, we view the company hiring workers as the social institution that is forming the basic structure. As a social institution, it needs to improve the quality of life of its citizens, which we can look at as either the consumers of the company or the citizens of the country the company is based in.
If we view the consumers as the citizens of the institution, hiring foreign workers can seem to improve their quality of life. Offshoring lowers the costs of labor, which in turn lowers the costs of the product, so consumers can save money, and the company makes more money. However, if offshoring is done by many companies in the United States, this benefit deteriorates. If more companies hire foreign workers then the quality of life for consumers will suffer due to not having steady jobs, or not being able to find jobs. Consumers then won’t even be able to buy products at these lower prices, rendering offshoring useless. Also, by Rawls’s ideas, hiring foreign workers in the hopes of lowering costs is at the expense of consumer’s basic liberties and quality of life; therefore, they are valuing social goods, in this case profit, above all, which is unethical.
If we view the citizens of the country the company is based in as the citizens the company is supposed to be protecting, then offshoring is definitely viewed as unethical. Even if the company wants to improve the conditions the foreign workers are operating in, the company has no ethical obligation to do so, they are required to aid their own citizens first [3]. Rawls supports institutions helping the least advantaged in society so they receive the best outcome they can, but this is specific to the citizens under the institution, which here is those in the same country as the company; it doesn’t involve intervening in other countries and their citizens. Also, helping workers in another country directly lowers the quality of life of potential workers from the country the company is based in. They lose out on job opportunities, and because lower paying jobs are typically offshored, this directly disadvantages the least advantaged in society, when institutions are ethically required to improve the standing of the least advantaged according to Rawls. The only way offshoring would be ethical is if the workers in the company’s country aren’t losing out on job opportunities, and in this case that isn’t true. Rawls does support institutions helping other burdened countries so they can establish an effective government, but this doesn’t apply here, since offshoring is typically done in India, where there is already an established government [3]. Companies from the United States do not have an ethical obligation to give job opportunities to another country; instead, the other nation’s companies or government have the ethical obligation to provide job opportunities to increase the quality of life of their citizens.
Before the analysis, I viewed hiring foreign workers as unethical. I believe companies should hire within their own country first, and offshore when completely necessary. Companies shouldn’t value economic gain above the needs of workers and citizens of their own country. The main reason for offshoring is for lower hiring costs, which yields greater profit for the company, but this is at the expense of workers in the United States. However, I previously thought the lower costs was purely a benefit for consumers. After reviewing Rawls ideas, most of my beliefs are solidified, but I don’t see the lower prices as purely a benefit. When offshoring becomes more widespread, and spreads to more than just lower paying jobs, consumers won’t benefit from the lower prices, as they won’t hold steady jobs to afford even these lower prices. Those who do the hiring at companies can use an ethical analysis to influence their decision on whether to hire foreign or domestic workers. Rawls ideas can help someone in charge of hiring by viewing the ethical obligations a company has to its citizens, and how much influence it has over its citizens’ lives.
Ethics is applied to the industry of computing to give direction to workers in the industry. The ideas of John Rawls can be applied to the ethical issue of hiring foreign workers. His ideas put on emphasis on institutions’ ethical obligation to improve the quality of life of its citizens, which in this case the institution is the company, while the citizens are the consumers or the citizens of the company’s country of origin. The citizens and consumers are disadvantaged when a company hires foreign workers, so Rawls’s ideas view offshoring as unethical. Companies are meant to serve its citizens, and not value profit above all, so they should focus on creating opportunities for those in their country of origin.","References

Mariam Keita

ICSI 300Z Societal and Ethical Implications of Computing
September 12, 2020","In the modern times of technological innovation, there has been a rise in concern over the righteousness of computing. In a world where most, if not all, attributes of technology directly affect the lives of individuals, the morals and ethics behind these ever-advancing technologies often get glossed over due to their unfamiliarity. The obstacle of overlooking the ethics of computing mires itself in the terms and conditions of a nation’s social contract along with what constitutes a proper political system. Political philosopher John Rawls agreeably defines a proper society to consist of citizens that willingly utilize the veil of ignorance to explore methods that will make for the most proper social and political system. In this essay, the scenario of whether a software company should hire US programmers or Indian programmers in conjunction with the Rawls’ veil of ignorance phenomenon will be explored. Given that the software company adheres to the social contract of the United States, where the company is located, outsourcing Indian programmers over American programmers poses to be an act of contrived moral resentment portrayed as the company’s way of combatting social and political justice within the United States.
Individuals who use the veil of ignorance when making an ethical decision embody the model social and political system, suggesting that when people factor in aspects like race, gender, religion, etc. to come to a consensus, they fail to remain in the default setting provided by their political system’s social contract, leading to the creation of unethical choices. People are adopted into systems that allow for specific liberties that do not infringe drastically upon their lives, yet the responsibility of the people arises as deciding to what extent their freedom is morally righteous. Anyone may make a decision to exercise their freedoms, but this does not automatically make it an ethical use of said freedoms. Looking back at the scenario, a software company may be set on finding their programmers based on whatever group of persons brings in the most profit at the end of the project. It cannot be prematurely assumed that the software company holds bad intentions for wanting to make the most profit since “[there] is nothing inherently unethical about choosing the cheaper of two products, services, or employees.” Instead, looking at the company’s standing may aid in deciding whether or not sourcing Indian programmers over US programmers makes for the most honorable decision. In the situation that the software company possesses enough funds to go with the US programmers and still makes the choice to hire Indian programmers, that would be considered an irresponsible act. The company would then be exploiting the Indian programmers by going with the least expensive option. The company owns the means to go with the more expensive option, in this case the US programmers, yet choose not to for reasons of personal gain. Rawls highlights in what he calls the difference principle that a disadvantaged group in a society must “end up with at least as many such advantages as would the least advantaged under any alternative arrangement”. This principle illustrates the software company to be unwise due to the people at the lowest rank of society not having the same resources as those above them. For advantaged factions of a society to squander resources set aside for the disadvantaged makes for an improper social and political structure solely due to unethical and selfish resolutions being made.
Applying the Rawlsian theory that for a society to embody the essence of justice, all of its members must wear the veil of ignorance when making a decision concerning the liberties of others. Contemplating whether to hire Indian programmers over US programmers automatically takes the veil of ignorance off the software company given that the company’s deciding factors not being completely unbiased. Whilst wearing the veil of ignorance, a person within a system turns blind to all social factors and only understands the “basic facts about biology, economics, physics, and any other relevant scientific facts.” The reason for this being that there are no biases based on gender, wealth bracket, race, or any other social element relating to one’s demographics. On the surface, it would seem as though the software company wears the veil of ignorance, yet the company is looking into other societies, in this case India, to solve the problems that the US currently deals with, proving they take demographics into consideration. Now commonplace for a company to think about cost when making significant decisions, it becomes unjust for a society to do so because there exists a chance for it to be perceived as artificial moral resentment, as aforementioned, which develops into a fake portrayal of wearing the veil. A very popular example of this phenomenon is clothing companies that claim to be ethical or fair trade. These types of companies falsify an image that the clothes purchased by consumers get made by an employee in a third world country and the buyer’s purchase aids the worker in making a living wage. The company fails to mention that the workers operate in terrible conditions and often work for several hours, potentially with no type of break. Comparing the software company with the “ethical” clothing company, both utilize a fake veil, one where the main concern materializes as being frustrated with the unfairness within the societies in which one lives. The frustrations come from the viewpoint that developed countries need to make it their duty to offer under developed countries a chance at the opportunities of the well-off countries. Had the software (or  “ethical” clothing) company solely considered options within the system where the persons live, this would have been a correct and just use of the veil, further illuminating how outsourcing in this scenario directly indicates that the veil of ignorance was abandoned.
There cannot exist a just system where the members do not correctly utilize, or even worse, completely neglect Rawls’ veil of ignorance phenomenon that states an individual only understands scientific facts and nothing concerning demographics. The reason being that knowing and taking in factors such as race, gender, religion tend to have a multitude of other underlying biases and thus if such biases exist in a society, it becomes hard to maintain justice given that poses to be the main characteristic of a social and political system. Individuals should be trusting of the social structure in which they live, meaning ethical decision must be made as often as possible for the betterment of society, explaining why the most ethical action for the software company to make in the scenario would be to hire US programmers as not to further encourage the veil of ignorance from being taken off or deserted.","References

Societal And Ethical Implications
15th September 2020","As with all other things that include morals and rule, computer ethics are a set of principles that control the use of computers. Computers have had an increasing effect of society as years go by and as computers evolve, new ethical standards are being created by computer ethics. Whether to hire US or Indian programmers? With the already complexity experienced by many companies, surely they don’t need problems such as unethical use of computer technology, that is exposed to the public.
Several reasons contribute to why ethics have an importance in computing. Mainly to control dishonesty in businesses and promote fair competition as well as to encourage social and moral values in society. “Rawls sought to establish principles for proper political power in a society with people of varying religions, viewpoints, lifestyles, and so on.” Basically widening the scope of possibilities and removing restrictions. “Rawls, like other social contract theorists, said that reasonable people, recognizing that a legal (or political) structure is necessary for social order, will want to cooperate on terms that all accept, and they will abide by the rules of society, even those they do not like.” However, his opinion was not liked by many but he still made a strong and valid point. If we come back to the point of either hiring US or Indian Programmers, most Indians are taught to be disciplined, ready to fulfil certain tasks and obligations. They are very committed to their area of work, even if it means to sacrifice their own spare time, or putting in extra hours.
“In many instances, there are either no rules or an incomplete understanding of guidelines to direct behavior. Computer technology permeates the workplace and suggest that a lack of guidance has led to situations where ethical questions with respect to computer usage are multiplying.” Both US and Indian programmers are great candidates for a company, but being raised in two different ways really their perspective to everything and how they think. Paying US programmers more would be considered unfair to Indian programmers as they deserve the same amount of pay for their work, as per government rules too. As the amount of time put in is directly proportional to the money earned. Rawls’ foundation is consistent with an emphasis on liberties (negative rights). “Rawls distinguishes his system of justice by adding a strong requirement for claim rights (positive rights): a just and fair political system will ensure that all citizens have sufficient means to make effective use of their freedoms.” Computer ethics stretch back to mid-1900’s but they are being recently implemented in modern companies and businesses. The use of personal internet in a workplace is strictly frowned upon but as recent studies show, it is being done. However, the concept of breaks are added in jobs so the mind can refresh one again and then concentrate when its time to work again. “The fairness and practical consequences of election campaigns of this very specific political policy are hotly debated. Rawls has made a leap that appears inconsistent with his emphasis that people of good will disagree on important issues and that a proper political system does not impose the views of one group on another.”
“Personal norms, co-worker norms, and organizational norms are taken into account as employees make ethical decisions (Sims and Keon, 1999). A conceptual model showing the relationship among these factors in the general organizational setting as well as an excellent review of the literature related to each is given by Cassell et al. (1997). In the Cassell et al. model(1997, p. 1089), formal controls and social controls (peer influences) are shown to influence the behavior of the individual. A similar model for Computer Technology (CT) ethical decision making was developed and tested for the Computer Technology setting (Henry and Pierce, 1994; Pierce and Henry, 1996). It is especially difficult for an individual to decide what action to take if co-workers expect one action, organizational management another, and one's personal judgement indicates yet another course of action. This ethical ambivalence constitutes what Waters and Bird (1987) call ""moral stress"" which is described as ""... an incon-gruence between organizational and individual perspectives on ethical matters.""(Wyld and Jones, 1997, p. 470). Constructs such as ""moral stress"" and co-worker norms have Been proposed and tested in the general business setting but not applied specifically to CT situation”
So when it comes to Indian programmers, they are committed to the team and if anyone is having a problem with their code, they are there to help them. They also stay calm even when the work assigned is very stressful. However, this is not the case with US programmers which generally only work on what they’re currently doing and leave others on their own. Indian programmers have found to have a really strong work ethic. They are dependable and get the job done within no time. As facts state, more than 75% of firms have ranked Indian programmers more loyal and efficient. There’s a clear reason why more jobs are held in IT and programming fields by Indian programmers rather than US programmers currently in the United States of America. As earlier discussed, cost is overall less with the same or even better performance of work. In my personal opinion, hiring programmers from other parts of the world is beneficial as they are passionate to work in a country like USA and in huge companies as well as to live the American Dream.","References

Societal and Ethical Implications of Computing
14 September 2020","The issue of hiring foreign workers for a software project is a complex and interesting one, with many facets that one might not consider at first glance. Either a utilitarian lens or a Kantian one can be applied to this problem, among other schools of ethics, but the ideas of philosopher John Rawls, including his “veil of ignorance”, are of particular interest here. Through analysis of the ethical dilemma and research into John Rawls’ philosophy, I’ve determined that, based on the lenses at my disposal, hiring the foreign workers is an ethical choice.
I can’t say with great certainly what my vision of the importance of ethics in computing is, and even less so what it will shape into as we progress in this class. I took this class to challenge and develop my limited ideas of ethics, so currently my vision on the matter remains vague. However, I do believe that the study of ethics itself is critical for the future of this industry and the world. Self-driving cars, information collection, facial recognition software, and of course, employing foreign programmers are all examples of ethical issues that all responsible professionals must be able to confront. After all, as today’s world relies more and more on computers, it is becoming increasingly clear that we, as computing students and professionals, play an important part in leading our society into an unsure future.
The issue at hand, introduced by the textbook is as follows:
You are a manager at a software company about to begin a large software project. You will need to hire dozens of programmers. Using the Internet for communication and software delivery, you can hire programmers in another country at a lower salary than programmers in your country. Should you do this [1]?
As a manager, it might be tempting to choose the foreign programmers, who are from India in this specific case. After all, if workers are offering lower rates, why not choose the least expensive option? Using different ethical principles, you can come to different conclusions. The text presents multiple different solutions through the lens of utilitarianism; when weighing the amount of money paid to either party, the answer is to choose the American programmers, while the Indian programmers might be the better solution if you’re considering the job opportunities or salaries available to them [2]. Additionally, one might also consider the customers of the software project in the equation. Customers would obviously prefer to pay a lower price for a product, and with them included, I believe that hiring the Indian programmers would be the utilitarian choice.
Another lens through which to examine the issue would be a Kantian one. The text makes the point that, since we are trading money for work, the workers are a means to an end, and as long as they are not treated entirely as such, Kant’s principle is applicable [3]. Treating the Indian workers as an end, there are several factors you must consider: their autonomy to offer whatever wages they want, their working conditions, and the opportunities available to them in their own country [4]. Personally, I believe that the Kantian approach favors the Indian programmers as well. If they are a means to an end as well as an end themselves, then I believe that includes respecting their choices of salary and giving them opportunities that they might otherwise not have.
An ethical philosophy we haven’t used in class before, that being the ideas of John Rawls, is also a way to approach this moral dilemma. Born in 1921 [5], Rawls was a social contract theorist who believed in “justice as fairness” [6]. To explain his principle of justice as fairness, he uses “the original position”, a thought experiment [7] that assumes that individuals are inclined to give up some of their freedoms for a legal or political structure in order to benefit society as whole, rather than their own selfish interests [8]. A core component of this thought experiment, and the idea I will be utilizing in order to solve this problem, is the “veil of ignorance.” The veil or ignorance, designed to protect the “most vulnerable and least-advantaged members of society” [9], assumes that decision-makers are unaware of any facts about involved individuals that might unjustly influence a decision, while retaining general knowledge that would help to inform just choices [10]. Not only do the parties not know the “race, ethnicity, gender, age, income, wealth, natural endowments, comprehensive doctrine, etc. of any of the citizens in society, or to which generation in the history of the society these citizens belong”, they are also unaware of the specific structure of the society itself [11]. However, they are still expected to understand the basics of human sociality and psychology, as well as concepts such as scarcity, economics, and differences in lifestyle and interests [12]. According to Rawls’ philosophy, this elimination of possible biases is the best method of achieving fairness, which in turn leads to justice.
Applying Rawls’ ideas of justice and the veil of ignorance to the ethical dilemma of hiring Indian programmers reveals a unique solution. Since the veil of ignorance forbids knowledge such as ethnicity and societal structure, we do not know that the foreign workers are from India, or that they are even foreign at all. We also do not know their current income or the conditions that they are living in, so that can’t be a factor either. The only difference between the two groups of workers we know is that one group is offering to work for less money than the other. Based on basic economic knowledge, which the veil of ignorance allows us to have, we can determine that choosing the workers that are offering lower wages will reduce expenses and allow the company to potentially sell the product at a lower price point for consumers. Therefore, when Rawl’s philosophies are applied to the problem, the ethical solution appears to be hiring the Indian programmers.
Before I started this analysis and read the required texts, my initial reaction was to hire the American programmers, as it felt unethical to pay offshore Indian workers less money than I would domestic workers to reduce costs. However, this assignment made me realize that there are several other factors to consider, including respect of the Indian workers’ autonomy, current opportunities for them, and the cost to consumers depending on my choices.
Although they are based on a hypothetical situation with limited known factors, my results might be of interest to a real software company facing a similar dilemma. As long as the ethical principles are still applicable, other types of companies or firms might be able to utilize these results as well.
The dilemma of hiring foreign workers for lower wages than domestic workers is a deceptively complex one, with many factors and applicable solutions. Using utilitarian and Kantian ethics, as well as the ideas of John Rawls, my analysis concludes that hiring the foreign workers is an ethical choice. Based on the lower prices for customers and the opportunities being offered to the Indian programmers that might not otherwise have them, hiring them satisfies utilitarian requirements. Meanwhile, Kant’s principles seem to favor the Indian programmers as well, as viewing them as an end means respecting their autonomy and offering them opportunities to work. Finally, the veil of ignorance obscures all differences in nationality and current income, so the only applicable choice when considering Rawls’ philosophy is the option that potentially saves money for the customers.","References

The person that has access to confidential information should conduct themselves with integrity and hold themselves to a code of conduct. IT professionals must adhere to policies concerning the ethical use of IT. For example, just because the IT person has access to usernames and passwords, this does not mean they should access it just because they can. The IT professional needs to hold themselves to a high moral standard that will protect personal private information. By practicing the highest level of ethical conduct, it would ensure that a given business has a reputation of trust and will maintain the business itself. Therefore, the importance of ethics in the industry of computing is critical to maintaining a secure service for businesses.
The practice of hiring offshore IT programmers and other IT support services has generated many different views on the practice. For example, some positive aspects for hiring offshore IT works is that it saves money for businesses which increases its profits. Also, it provides jobs and income for disadvantaged workers and helps to improve developing or impoverished nations. Furthermore, hiring offshore builds good relations with other countries and help paly a role in economic growth. On the other hand, some ethical issues arise such as job loss for US workers as jobs get sent offshore. Another question about it is businesses look as if they are taking advantage of offshore workers desperateness for a job. These offshore workers can suffer poor working conditions such as unsafe office space, no air conditioning and more. In addition, there is a question about the fairness of not being equally paid for the same IT jobs. Finally, another issue to consider would be about laws at foreign nations that do not protect workers such as not providing healthcare. Given the varying points of view on whether hiring offshore is ethical, can there be a solution that addresses what should be considered?
American philosopher John Rawls argued, “that political power is proper only if we would expect all citizens to reasonably endorse its basic, or constitutional principles” [1]. We know that Rawls focuses on freedoms and to act without interference (negative rights), yet he also adds that a focus on imposing obligation to help others (positive rights) [1]. With the understanding that Rawls places high attention to protecting the least advantaged people, should the hiring of off-shore workers be banned all together? Perhaps taking a position of not hiring offshore completely is too drastic a measure for the sake of pure ethics. Surely more needs to be looked into before taking such a harsh step. First, knowing that not hiring any offshore workers could cause great financial loss for foreign workers and that could have a terrible impact on them [1]. In an online source known as The Scalers, it notes, “Low wages are not an absolute concept but a relative one. So, despite earning a fraction of their American counterpart’s salary, an Indian software developer’s cost of living is low and their purchasing power strong. When it comes to wages, larger numbers aren’t always better.” [3] Clearly, we must consider the economic differences between the US and the foreign nation(s) before making such an ethical judgement.
An Australian author,  of Smart Company, wrote an article about the ethics of offshoring. Jones argues about the old school thought of slave wages and sweat shops of Asia as being outdated [4]. He speaks to the concern on the ethics of low wages. Jones notes that Australian employers spend money on working conditions abroad as well as fair pay for offshore workers; by doing this, it provides employers gaining high quality work in return [4]. In the written work, A Gift of Fire: Social, Legal, and Ethical Issues for Computing Technology, it states that “…that their working conditions would be worse than the working conditions that U.S. workers expect” [2]. I believe it depends on the salary amount and the additional funding for working conditions; maybe it is enough to make improvements in their country overall and creates equity. For example, Linden states, “Without exception, all the many hundreds of offshore offices of Australian companies that I have personally inspected have been A-grade working environments by Australian standards.  Not crowded, well air conditioned, comfortable chairs, standard work hours, and regular breaks and holidays which comply with the local employment laws.” [3] We can learn from the best ethical practices that Australia uses in maintaining ethics of offshore workers and apply them to U.S. businesses practices.
An article in the Harvard Business Review discussed an issue against this kind of globalization and relayed that foreign nations might try to avoid their country’s environment, health, and safety for off-shore workers. Their (other countries) standards might not be acceptable to combat this issue however, businesses can create policies to hold foreign nations accountable and put pressure to provide proper working conditions [5]. This article also provided some examples of policies to be considered, noting “These policies cover such issues as: , wages and hours, living conditions, worker safety, adherence to environmental standards, non-discrimination and non-harassment” [5]. In the spirit of Rawls, who leans heavily on positive rights, applies with the idea of imposing obligation to help others.
Before this analysis on the hiring of off-shore IT workers, I did not realize the extent of the many issues surrounding the ethics of offshore hiring. As I explained in my vision of ethics for the industry of computing, I largely focused on how I would conduct myself as an IT worker. Now that I think about working someday at a given U.S. business that hires off-shore workers, I would become a part of a company that may or may not have proper ethical practices, and I would have to ask myself, should I be working for this company? I would never want to be a part of a company that would take advantage of other people’s desperateness of need for work, along with knowing they would suffer poor working conditions and not being equitably paid. I never thought about foreign nations that may have unacceptable laws that would not protect workers. After this analysis, when I apply for a position at a business for an IT position I will definitely ask about their ethical practices and if they hire off-shore. If their practices are ethically substandard, I could make suggestions based on what I have learned from completing this research. 	U.S. businesses that offer jobs off-shore could tell foreign governments that there would be no job offers unless there is proper conditions and benefits provided. Why would a given foreign nation care? The reason would be, that their nation would likely gain higher GDP benefits, improve standard of living, and more. That would surely motivate other nations to comply with US demands in encouraging ethical practices.
In conclusion, my vision of ethical practices has broadened to include being ethical on a global level. I am more aware of the responsibilities of ethics that adds to my knowledge and I feel like I have further developed my personal vision on ethical practices. I look forward to being able to share what I know and perhaps lend my knowledge on these issues and they (a given company) could consider what I bring to them of what I know and am concerned about. When I think about ethical practices on a global level, I understand that businesses save money and increases their profits, hiring off-shore provides jobs/income for the disadvantaged, can help impoverished nations, could help economic growth in foreign nations, and build good relations with other nations. However, there needs to be assurances that the off-shore workers are gaining equitable wages, proper working conditions, and have strong laws to protect the workers, and I see how I can now play a part in making that happen.

September 14, 2020","It is important to clarify that the decision to hire either Indian programmers or American programmers is based solely on the question “what is best for the company?”. Ethics are principles based on an individual’s morality, it guides what they see as right or wrong. This multi-level field of science has an impact on decisions ranging from the smallest daily decisions to the biggest life decisions. On the subject matter of computer programming, the ethics of hiring in the industry should not be based on an individual’s race, color or nationality. It should be rather based on their genuine interest and passion for programming.  Developing on Immanuel Kant’s principles,  an individual should live life doing what they are genuinely passionate about rather than striving towards worldly-oriented things. Many would argue that the company should hire Indian programmers because it can present life changing opportunities for them. However, it’s important to recognize that hiring programmers who are genuinely interested in programming is best for the company, as opposed to hiring programmers who are more likely to be in the industry for financially practical reasons.  Hiring American programmers would be beneficial for the company because there’s an increase possibility of finding more engaged programmers.
America is renowned for its healthcare field. The field has a high demand because of the different branches in the healthcare field that can used to create jobs. According to Gili Malinsky, three out of six health care job listed was ranked top 4 highest demand job in America. However, when compared to the jobs in the field of computer science or within the range of technology, there is noticeable drop in the interest’s as these jobs as they were  ranked 11th and 15th on the list [1]. With the focus on healthcare, theirs a higher possibility of finding programmers in America who are passionate and dedicated to their jobs because as less people are committing to the field due to it demands in the market, it’s more likely to find individual who actually have love computer science. According to the, Why Passionate Employees Are Your Most Valuable Asset,  “Passion is the trait that makes the most difference in employee output and commitment to your company…passionate employees and hiring people that share their drive for business, you’ll get more out of your team [2].” These types of employees are valuable and more reliable when it comes to quality of work because they  have a fuel that drives them to take the extra steps and sacrifices to produce efficient programs. Companies that build on this type of foundation tend to have great amount of success as a business
On other hand, India is known having for having expert in the field of computer programming. In fact, computer programming is one of the most common job in the country. Stated by Karen Gilchrist in, The 15 fastest-growing jobs in India,  “As  continues to prove itself… roles in technology are set to gain pace as the country’s most in-demand jobs. Blockchain development emerged as India’s fastest-growing profession for 2020. [3]” It can be argued that Indian programmers can use computer programming as end means to change their livelihood and improve their communities. This go to shows that many individuals that become computer programmers in India are looking to escape their reality to the one that they envision.
If Indian programmers use their opportunity to work for American company for person gains then their intension can be questioned. Are they really devoted to grind? Or do they just want this job for the offers it presents?  “We can argue that treating the Indian programmers as ends in themselves includes respecting the choices and trade-offs they make to better their lives according to their own judgment”[6]. In hindsight,  it’s possible for them to lose sight for the purpose of their employments, which could later  backfire on the company. “…dispassionate employee may keep their nose to the grindstone for a while and get the job done, if they lack passion for the work, then they’re missing the key ingredient for sustained, long-term performance” [2].
Although most Indian programmers are more knowledgeable than some American programmer, the aspect can be improved with teaching and experience. However, what can’t be taught is commitment,  determination and passion, which are values that are develop. “You can’t teach passion. Employees either have it or they don’t, and no matter how well you do at creating a work environment that encourages it, finding passionate employees is pivotal to your organization’s success” [2]. These values are essential  when looking for employees that can improve the company than rather slowing down its progression.
Modern philosopher John Rawls provided useful ethical guidelines that “sought to establish principles for proper political power in a society with people of varying religions, viewpoints, lifestyles [5].” Rawls focus point was on fairness and justice for every individual despite their economic status. Rawls wanted to protect the most vulnerable and least advantage members of society, by choosing policies that does not leave these individual in worse position they were in before.  When applying the idea of Rawls to the dilemma at hand, hiring individuals  who are genuine interested in programming, while looking out for the well begin for the company will have a bigger impact on the industry of computer programming. Hiring America programmers might affect Indian programmers’ short term, but in the long run create a path to help foreign programmers around the world the ability to pursue future employments for well-developed companies. It can be argued that a improving the society of America can have a chain effect on other countries that are in the computing industry through creation of jobs and software development. This  will have a bigger impact on more people as appose to helping out the Indian programmers immediately. “Rawls’ emphasis on concern for the least well off, however, is a reminder to consider impacts on such people; a loss or harm to them can be more devastating than to someone in a better position [5].”
Before applying the idea of Rawls to the scenario one could ignore the condition that least advantage group might face if either demographic hired, but the use of his ideas speak volume on the topic of  how human beings are morally advocated to have good impact on the society. These results based on Rawls views can be used for companies looking to hire large number of workers in the computing industry. Amazon for examples is set to open  “…about 33,00 new corporate and tech jobs currently available across the country [4]”. Amazon being a global company that has buyer and sellers in different part of the world, would have to deiced what type of employees they want to hire. Do they prefer employees who are devoted and willing to do anything to get the job done or are just looking for the opportunities who just in it  for the benefits? Amazon can use these results to make a decision about the direction they want head when trying to hire many of their workers. They can put the company first and hire individuals who will create long term success for every individual or hire based on needs  for short term success of a certain group of individuals .
Overall, when the intension of the company is place first, the better choice between the Indian and American programmers can be argued in several ways. Indian programmers doing the piratical thing by pursing a better life by using their ability to programmer at a high level is not a dreadful act, but it’s not in the best interest of the company. The probability of finding a  programmer who is solely dedicated to the work is higher  in America, than in India because of the demand rates in each country.  If the company wants the higher quality of work they should look to eliminate any  possible chances of distractions that may interfere with employees.","Bibliography

Societal and Ethical Implications of Computing
Sep 10, 2020","When talking about ethics, it is more important to consider personal interests. Personal interests are, to a large extent, part of ethics. You can talk about ethics without mentioning personal values and morality. The idea of computer industry ethics is not only philosophically important; it may mean the survival of an industry. When we hire foreigners in the computer industry, we are usually competing against morality. Indians are difficult to fit in because they do not share common cultural background, familiar laws, and judicial procedures of local ethical standards of conduct which certainty is elusive. Hence, should companies invest in foreign workers where morality and profitability are violated? Should companies tolerate local discriminatory employment practices? If companies in the United States consider moving their facilities to India that lack of strict environmental and health regulations, or if they choose to employ their people as managers and other senior positions in the United States, which criteria should be adopted?
When Indian children who grew up in homes with advanced computer systems benefited from huge improvements in living standards over the past 20 years to become software engineers, the increasingly favored heat about software innovation has now diminished. Most American companies employ a large number of programmers from India due to various reasons. According to GILD, Indian developers' core mathematical and logical analysis capabilities are 11 percent higher than their US counterparts, and when we talk about costs now, it is obvious that there is a huge difference between the two, with Indian developers working at lower costs by providing the same quality of service.
When we are talking about applying Kant’s rules of respect, American companies are generally treating Indian programmers as their profit-making purpose, hence Indian workers are much more popular than American programmers.  In recent years, American technology companies have begun to expand rapidly. Because of their shortage of local technical personnel, these companies hope to tap and recruit talents from abroad. India, as a poorer country in the world, attaches great importance to education. Programming, web design, IT, engineering and other fields are very good. Moreover, the cost of living in India is very low. Many people are about US$150 a month. In addition, India is a former British colony, which gives them a natural advantage in English, which is essential for communicating with Americans. Although China has a large population and software talents are at the leading level in the world, language barriers make it difficult for American companies to enter the Chinese market, so most American companies will first consider Indians.  It is easy to conclude that hiring Indians is a morally wrong decision because we do not think of a hundred thousand American job opportunities are taken away by foreigners in the United States. We consider it is not fair to local Americans, however, most of us could argue that capitalism is a natural choice that American companies choose Indian workers over Indian workers in terms of cost-efficiency.
Whether a software developer can effectively communicate with the supervisor takes a major part of a role in deciding to employ American programmer or Indian programmer. Given the fact that most Indian’s English proficiency is much lower than Americans, however, they are more efficient in writing codes and doing their jobs. When we are thinking of Kant’s rules of consistency, we will derive the conclusion that almost every company will make the same decisions that they tend to choose Indian programmers than Americans, it’s a universal and ubiquitous sense in the United States. We are all known that the United States is famous for immigrations, and it is literally an immigrant country over these past hundred years. H1B visa, which is a working visa for most of the American people don’t know about, it’s a special visa for foreigners to stay and work freely just as local American people after they are sponsored by some companies. We monitor a trend that over the past ten years, big tech companies are more and more favor giving and sponsoring H1B visas to Indian programmers which might take up[ nearly 50% of the H1B visa pool according to the sources.  Based on a common rule that the US companies hire equally and openly regardless of their nationality and race, the most common and consistent choice of them is choosing Indian programmers over American Programmers. Increasing Indian workers within the company will bring even higher diversity and working efficiency to the tech-companies, hence, the numbers of Indian H1B visa applicants are skyrocketing every year. However, we witness that the USCIS rejection rate has increased from 2%- 4% a few years ago till today almost 40%. On one hand, the overall applicants are increasing dramatically because more and more Indian students are allowed to study aboard in the US and successfully stay to work after; the US immigration officials notice that trend. The other, in order to protect the local job opportunities that persevered for American programmers, the USCIS has to take action in terms of American graduates’ petition of restricting over income immigrations.  The increasing number of work visa denials means that, in addition to the business difficulties brought to the company and customers, the work culture treasures of an Indian technology outsourcer are declining. This company has reasonable opportunities to work in the United States, and may Finally receive a green card. But we expect these effects to be concentrated in what economists call non-tradable sectors. When people produce haircuts, health care, and restaurant meals that cannot travel, they get more income by crossing the border. But computer work is a typical tradable commodity. Although it is easy to transport many types of physical goods across continents, it is much easier to move software. So you might think that the difference in salary between American and Indian programmers largely reflects the difference in skills. Even if Indian programmers born in the United States earn higher incomes, this may only reflect the shortage of H-1B visas. Maybe it's just that India's best programmers come here disproportionately.
To conclude, it is arduous to make a judgment that if hiring Indian programmers are morally virtue over hiring Americans. However, due to a natural profit-oriented idea, it’s not necessarily judged by us, not the market itself. Indeed, mounting H1B Visa Indian programmers will bring intense competition among the local jobs market, and might damage local American worker’s long-term profits when such a serious competition induced by foreign workers. From one side, we seek to include working diversity and greater work cost-efficiency as mature multi-national enterprises. On the other hand, we can not satisfy both parties from the same setting that such an increasing competition is inevitable at the end of the day. The government has taken action in response to most of the Americans’ inner voice by restricting work-visa and students that come from Asia countries. It might not be the most optimal solution nowadays since globalization is a mounting trend as 2020 given such a special global pandemic is happening right now. However, the market itself is the only solution that we could rely on at the end of the day, there is eventually no right or wrong answer regarding hire Indians programmers over American programmers today.

September 13.2020","In this paper we will discuss if it is ethical to hire U.S. programmers or Indian programmers to our U.S. company. We will apply different ideas to look at the situation of hiring U.S. programmers or Indian programmers to our U.S. company. The different ideas type of ideas will help us discuss a solution for the issue above.
The vision that I have on the importance of ethics for the industry of computing is that everyone is treated fair. Fair because to me it is the moral right thing to do and treat everyone fairly and treat everyone how you like to be treated. It should not matter what country you come from or gender. You should be treated fairly as a worker in the industry of computing like any worker in any industry. If the problem of ethics is happening in the industry of computing which is already happening, we should help solve the problem of ethics. Solving by looking at what is causing the issue of making it not ethical or not and looking to see if the issue is morally right or wrong.
Social contracts theory, utilitarianism, deontological and Rawls’s idea will be used to see different views on the scenario that is given. Utilitarianism: the idea to see it as an act in morally right that act causes the greatest happiness for the greatest number[2]. Deontological is that the moral rules are more important than motives of the actor or possible consequences[2]. Social contract theory developed Thomas Hobbes states that man acted in his own interest, no one is safe from physical harm and there is no ability to ensure the satisfaction of one’s needs[2]. The approach of the social contract theory developed by Thomas Hobbes applied in this scenario of the U.S. programmers or Indian programmers who to hire. The U.S. company will hire the Indian programmers not the U.S. programmers because it will be easier for them and cheaper as well for them. They will act on their own self-interest to better the company which wouldn't care about the ethical consequences that may occur. The next approach utilitarianism would hire the U.S. workers than the Indian workers because it is morally the right thing to hire U.S. workers. Hiring the Indian workers under this approach will not bring the greatest happiness for the greatest number. The Indian workers would probably be paid less and have poor working conditions. It would not bring the greatest happiness for the greatest number. In deontological the U.S. company will hire the U.S. programmers not the Indian programmers. The U.S. company will hire the U.S. programmers not the Indian programmers because it is morally the right thing to do under this approach. Hiring U.S. programmers not fearing the consequences because it is morally right is the viewpoint of the deontological. It's probably cheaper to hire the Indian worker than the U.S. worker but it is not morally the right thing to do. One of the ideas that arise in Rawls' views of the social structure is that there is a between the two parties[1]. In the Journal of Philosophy, it stated, “The idea allowed by the other parties to advance a justice conception that either benefits himself exclusively or fails to answer somehow the needs of all of them. And because the parties are equal in strength and power, no party can forcibly impose his biased justice conception on the others[1].” Which means that there will be a negotiation of conflicting interests of both parties[1]. In this situation the American company might negotiate within the company to see which one of the parties they will hire. There will be conflicts of interest in the company some might want to hire the American programmers, and some might want to hire the Indian programmers. As A result of the negotiation they will present the parties with the best answer to the problem. In this problem the company would hire the Indian workers because of how cheaper it is to hire than the American programmers. It is not morally right to hire them because you hire them for cheap and help save the company some money. Another idea of Rawls’s idea of the veil of ignorance, the idea of people that do not know ahead of time their place in society, their class position or social status, their place in the distribution of natural assets and abilities, their deeper aims and interests, or their particular psychological makeup[3]. In other words We imagine that each person behind the veil of ignorance does not know his or her gender, age, race, talents, wealth, and so on in the real world[2]. This idea can be applied to the problem because if we don't know the race, gender etc. of the workers that the company would hire the American programmers. They would hire the American programmers because the American workers live in the area where the company is.
Each of the approaches looks to see if it was ethical to hire U.S. programmers or the Indian workers for a U.S. company. Thomas Hobbes theory of social contract was the only one approach that we went over that agreed with the hiring of the Indian workers. It is the best interest of the U.S. company to hire them because it is cheaper for the company, so they save more money and make more money. Not caring about the consequence only acted on the self-interest of the company. Unlike the social theory by Thomas Hobbs theory, deontological states that the moral rules are more important than the consequence. So, by hiring the U.S. working is morally the right thing to do in this scenario. The consequence can be that hiring the Indian workers will be paid less without any benefits and have poor working conditions for them. Utilitarianism would want the company to hire U.S. workers instead of the Indian workers. It is morally the right thing to do that will cause the greatest happiness for the greatest number. Rawls’s idea of the social structure and the idea of the contractual agreement if this idea is applied the company will try to decide what group of programmers to hire and try to come up with a fair solution that both parties will agree on. The last idea of the Rawls is the veil of ignorance. It would be hard to apply this idea here because it would be hard hiring people for a job not knowing anything about them. Who can use this information is people who want to know some ideas or approaches of ethics in hiring of foreign workers? Also, by seeing the different approaches they can see which would hire foreign programmers or the American programmers.
Of all the approaches that we talk about the one that fits the best in this situation is utilitarianism because we should look at this problem to find what is morally right and will bring the greatest happiness for the greatest number. But in the real world the companies will be looking at their own self-interest like the ideas of Thomas Hobbes.

Societal and Ethical Implications of Computing
15 September 2020","I believe ethics in computing is very important in modern society. The ethics of technology changes a lot over time. People’s views change on a daily basis now that all of society is connected through the internet and social media. It was only just over a decade ago when the first smartphones were released, and we can see now how much they changed society. Since many people use technology and the internet, it is important that what they use is ethical. It can sometimes be easier for a company to act unethical rather than ethical. Acting unethical can also sometimes benefit the company while hurting the consumers. For example, a company could collect consumers information and then sell it to another company without the consumer knowing. This benefits the company since they are making more of a profit with little work but hurts the consumer since they do not know what their information is being used for. It is important for companies to act ethical so that consumers feel safe using their product and giving out their information.
There are both positives and negatives when deciding to hire foreign workers. A positive for the company would be that it is cheaper to hire a foreign worker than one in the United States. If a company were to hire someone from the United States, the average pay would be $70/hr [1]. If instead they decided to hire someone from another country like India, Ukraine, or Pakistan, the average salary would be below $50/hr [1]. Although the pay might be less for a foreign worker, the value may be similar or even higher depending on the workers location. Cheaper pay is not be the only reason to hire foreign workers. According to economists, “foreign workers help boost GDP, raise overall averages wages, and help the growth of the IT sector as well as the profits of tech companies” [2]. Deciding whether to hire foreign workers also depends on the project. You might not want to hire foreign workers to complete an entire project but only do certain aspects of it. It’s possible to split the work between workers in the country and foreign workers. The non-foreign workers could do the planning and more difficult tasks, while the foreign workers could focus more on the simple and time-consuming tasks. Splitting up the work like this can improve the efficiency of the company while still saving money and reducing mistakes that may come. Another benefit of hiring workers is that you can hire them short term or for just one project [3]. Hiring a worker for short term can save a lot of money since you are not committed to keep them on payroll after the task is complete. Contract work sounds less appealing to workers since it would not be a continuous source of income, and it is not guaranteed you will get another. Since foreign workers will do it for a much lower price, it tempts U.S. based companies to choose them over non-foreign workers.
Although it may be tempting for U.S. companies to hire foreign workers, it is also riskier. Since the foreign workers will not be in the same building, or even the same country as the company, it will be harder to communicate with the team [1]. It is much easier to explain a problem or communicate face to face rather than communicating via email or video calls. Many companies have whiteboards in their office so that teams can show or write out their ideas and work collaboratively. It would be more difficult to do this online since you would have to rely on software. It would take more time to write out emails or prepare documents to send to the foreign workers, rather than sharing or explaining what you want to someone working in the same office. If the company is communicating via online voice chat or video chat, they are relying on how good the internet connection is on both sides. If one side loses internet connection, it would be more difficult to communicate. If the internet connection is slow on either side, it might take a while to upload or download necessary files. The location of the foreign workers also plays a big role. Foreign workers may be active in a different time zone, which may affect when or how you communicate [1]. Communication is very important especially when people are working on the same project together. Coworkers would need to communicate to solve problems and to figure out who is doing what tasks. English is the international language of business and technology, but it may not be the native language of the foreign workers [1]. The workers may not be as familiar with English or they might have an accent which may make it more difficult to communicate. Foreign workers may also misunderstand what the company wants and may produce a product completely different. If this happens, the foreign workers may have to restart which would cost the company more money. Foreign workers might use different formatting or programming techniques than what the company is used to. Having the foreign workers format their files in a similar fashion may require more training. Another downside to hiring foreign programmers is the quality. The company would not be sure whether the quality of the code will be good or bad until its complete [3]. When hiring a non-foreign worker, you can get a good idea on how skilled they are based on the interview. Although companies might receive a resume or portfolio from a foreign worker, it will be hard to determine how skilled they are without seeing them work.
According to Sara Baase and Timothy Henry, the philosopher John Rawls’ view was “an action or a social or political structure is not ethical if it has the effect of leaving the least-advantaged people worse than they were before” [4]. This ties into deciding whether to hire foreign workers by choosing who benefits by getting the job. Should a foreign worker with a lower quality of life get the job or should the U.S. worker get the job at a higher salary for the same work. I think Rawls would support hiring the foreign workers since it would be helping the least-advantaged people.
I believe that companies should continue to hire foreign workers. Hiring foreign workers helps reduce the workload for U.S. workers and it saves the company money. Hiring foreign workers also encourages diversity in culture. They also can bring new ideas to the company that wouldn’t have been thought of without them. Foreign workers also offer different types of skills. If you only need one specific done quick, it would be best to hire a foreign worker with that specific skill, rather than hire a full-time employee in the United States. The main downside of hiring foreign workers is the difficult communication. I think the benefits of saving money would outweigh the disadvantage of communication. A solution to the communication problem would be to have some U.S. workers occasionally travel to the foreign country. The U.S. workers can train the foreign workers on formatting and other problems that may occur. It also gives the U.S. workers an idea of what the foreign setup looks like so it would be easier to diagnose issues remotely.","References

Normative Ethics in Computing: Hiring Foreign Workers","Ethics are the backbone of any given society. Ethics is an extremely thought-provoking field, and there exist many lines of thought to define how ethical an action is. The two main processes for defining ethics are deontological ethics, and consequentialism. Deontological ethics relies on a strict moral code that should be followed regardless of the outcome. Consequentialism is the opposite where the most ethical choice is the one that leaves the most people as happy as possible, regardless of what choice is made As long as humans have settled together there have been sets of laws made, which essentially outline what is deemed right and wrong by the society. As humans continue to advance technologically the laws, and moral codes, have also advanced. It is becoming more and more important to include, and put an emphasis on laws regarding computers, and their uses. As technology improves to the point of robots producing their own thoughts, Artificial Intelligence, and making decisions that may affect actual people in society, such as self-driving cars, it is imperative that we, as a society, define a moral code for such actions. It must be a forethought, not an afterthought. Avery real problem in our society today comes to mind involving the covid-19 pandemic. Apps designed to control the pandemic such as ones that alert a phone’s owner if they have been in contact with someone else’s phone that is infected with the virus. This is a very good idea, and benefits society as a whole, however, it can be exploited to damage society in the long term. Depending on how, and when these alerts are given it can steer people away, in certain areas, from participating in major elections, For example, see [1]. There are smaller, more industrial problems that need to be accounted for as well, such as the ethics of hiring foreign workers vs. hiring domestic workers. Would it be more ethical to hire the domestic workers for a higher salary, or the foreign worker for a lower salary? Although there are arguments for both sides the great philosopher John Rawls would consider it more ethical to hire the foreign worker. John Rawls was a consequentialist philosopher, who had some interesting ideas and principles that give a definitive answer to this problem.
Hiring foreign workers vs. domestic workers is a highly debated subject, however looking at it from a strictly ethical point of view, what would the argument be for hiring domestically? One of the biggest reasons to make for hiring the domestic worker over the foreign is the quality of working conditions, see [2]. The working conditions of domestic workers are most likely significantly better. This is possible because of laws in the United States that foreign countries may not have. It would be unethical to willingly pay someone to work in much worse conditions when you can instead pay someone to work in much better conditions. All humans are equal so it would be most ethical to put them in the best conditions possible. The other argument would be along the same lines that all humans should be counted the same. Essentially by paying foreign workers less for the same exact work you are supporting the idea that the foreign workers are just worth less money as human beings, which is clearly unethical. Looking at this problem from a deontological point of view, it would be possible to favor hiring the domestic worker. Using the maxim of everyone that is hiring should be placing the workers in the best working conditions possible in order to keep them safe, happy, and healthy. This would mean the company should hire the domestic workers because it is safer for them. That being said, looking at this problem purely from an ethics viewpoint most lines of thought would heavily favor hiring the foreign workers.
The two major lines of thought in normative ethics would both favor hiring the foreign workers. The first, deontological ethics, would require the company hires foreign workers. Deontologically speaking, the company should always hire the cheapest labor available, assuming the work done will be the same, regardless of who they are. Because it is assumed that the same work will be performed it would make sense to hire foreign workers. The other normative thought process, consequentialism, provides a much more interesting look at this problem. The great philosopher John Rawls proposes many ideas that give a new insight into this. One major idea of Rawls is that of the “veil of ignorance”. This is the idea that when a person must make an ethical decision for a society, it would be best if they did so having no idea what their status in the society would be. They would be of a random ethnicity, religion, and class. This would theoretically lead to them making the most fair decision possible for all parties involved because they would not have any idea which party they would belong to. This idea of the veil of ignorance, however, does not really apply to this problem. This is because when the company decides to hire the workers, they will either hire the foreign workers, or the domestic workers. Assuming the population ratios are even the person will have a 50% chance of being hired regardless. This person will also be working in the conditions of their given country regardless. John Rawls does give an idea that does have a definitive answer to this moral dilemma. This is the equality principle in his essay “Justice as Fairness: Political not Metaphysical”, see [3]. More specifically it is the difference principal. This is the idea that when given a problem, the most moral solution is the one that gives the greatest good to the worse-off people. When this principle is applied to the worker problem, it becomes apparent that the most ethical solution would be to higher the foreign workers. This is because if they are selling their work for less, it can be assumed that economically they are worse-off. Given that they also will have poorer working conditions there is no argument as to which worker is worse off. By giving the job to the foreign worker, and hopefully a chance to improve these conditions, it would clearly be more ethical to hire the foreign workers. By paying less for the work, your product will also most likely be cheaper, thus making your own country’s citizens, or whoever is buying the product, happier. This lines up with idea of consequentialism as a whole because it will make the greatest number of people the happiest. This problem is just one small example of the complexity of ethics in society. These problems become even more difficult to develop an ethical solution when it comes to the real world. Adding in-depth economic, and political, analysis to either response changes the overall effect on the world, thus complicating what would be an ethical answer. Arguably, removing those ideas when making this decision gives the decider a veil of ignorance, thus making hiring foreign workers from a global, non-biased perspective, the outright ethical choice in the matter.","Bibliography

Societal and Ethical Implications of Computing
09/15/2020","My vision of the importance of ethics for the industry of computing would be that it is something that the majority if not all can agree on. With the computing industry still being relatively new, there are still plenty of grey areas surrounding certain topics within the field. Whether it is about how to ethically handle users' data, how far is too far, or something as “simple” as hiring offshore. With the latter, I say it is “simple” because one would think the answer to that has already been answered with different industries like agriculture and recycling and that hiring within your own country would not only benefit your country, but it also prevents exploitation overseas. But with the computing industry, that terrain is fairly new, especially with the new technology that makes it easier to connect and work with people across the world. What makes it an ethical issue is primarily the reason as to why companies that consider hiring aboard to begin with. That reason being lower wages.
In the scenario, “You are a manager at a software company about to begin a large software project. You will need to hire dozens of programmers. Using the Internet for communication and software delivery, you can hire programmers in another country at a lower salary than programmers in your country. we assume the software company is in the United States and the manager is choosing between U.S. and Indian programmers [1]”, the prospective programmers are either from the U.S. (the home country), or India. Assuming that the skill levels are on par with each other, the only difference is that they are from different countries and that the Indian programmers would be paid a lower salary in comparison to the American programmers. Wanting to hire someone based on how much you would have to pay for their salary isn’t inherently unethical or a new concept. People pick the cheaper of two options a good amount of the time when quality isn’t the issue. But, taking advantage of someone and paying them less then they deserve, raises some ethical issues. Looking at this scenario in terms of creating/losing working opportunities for people, it would seem as though the company is taking away jobs from the U.S. and giving it overseas just to save money, but that would not be the case. “The sheer shortage of engineering talent int eh West is another problem in itself. In 2020, it is estimated that over 1 million engineering jobs in the US are expected to be unfilled. Businesses in the US and Western Europe are struggling to meet their in-house needs [2]”. Based on this study, it shows that there are plenty of jobs still out there going unfilled due to the lack of engineers, so that can be a valid reason as to why a company would look elsewhere for workers. In this scenario, at least judging from this study, there is not a shortage of jobs in the U.S. for U.S. citizens. There are a lot of angles one can look at the scenario, but first, a social contract that would help find an ethical solution is needed.
John Rawls had an idea that took the social contract theory further and based it on fairness. The way he believed would accomplish that is through a “veil of ignorance”. Behind a said veil of ignorance, people would choose policies that would be fair for all that also protects the vulnerable and least-advantaged members in society. This is possible due to everyone behind the veil of ignorance would not know their gender, age, race, talents, and so on, so the people choosing would not know where they stand in policymaking. On paper, this is great because people tend to vote/choose what is best with keeping their selves in mind. John Rawls has 2 general principles of justice that can structure society in the real world: the principle of equal liberty and the difference principle, where the principle of equal liberty calls for each person to have an equal right to the most extensive liberties, and the difference principle says social and economic inequalities should be arranged so that they are both to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged persons and attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions of equality of opportunity [3]. Using John Rawls's idea to the scenario, the justice of fairness would be to distribute the job to those who need the job the most. Basing your decision based on this alone would make you pick which of the 2 are at a disadvantage in life already. One can say that in this scenario, that would be the Indian programmers due to them willing to have a low wage, but that alone is not enough to say who really needs it the most. It also begs the question; how does one prove they need the job the most and is this job needed to help make their situation better? Because another thing John Rawls put emphasis on, is that an issue of making the decision of how many least-advantaged people must not be left worse off. “Some people believe it is unfair to both the U.S. and Indian programmers if the Indians get the jobs by charging less money [4]’. If people start lowering their expected pay in order to get a job, then it just becomes a competition of who can go the lowest and who is willing to hire at such cheap prices. Paying people less than thy deserve because they are desperate is not really ethical. Also, the lower you pay the lower the quality in some cases. So hiring the Indian programmers just solely off of the fact that you can pay them a lower salary and people are then being left without jobs because of that, then it starts a chain reaction leaving the least-advantaged people worse off, just like John Rawls warned.
In conclusion, John Rawls's idea is a good way to measure out if something is ethical. If you are a manager at a computing company and you see that paying someone overseas would be cheaper than paying someone in the country the company is based in, you would have to ask yourself if your reasoning is ethical and would you be leaving people worst off based on your decision. Giving the programming job to someone overseas would not really have that big of an impact to the number of jobs that are in the United States because of all of the unfilled engineering jobs, but that does not mean that you should not give them the job because not because there is not a shortage now, does not mean there will never be a shortage. Doing what everyone else would do on a daily bases and picking the cheaper of 2 options is not inherently bad, due to that being your money, but if only people who get hired are people who are willing to be paid lower than usual, then people would start lowering their expected salaries and now no one is being paid fairly for the work they are doing. Every decision has its consequence, but you have to choose what you believe makes something ethical and how you go about implementing it correctly.","References

ICSI 300Z: Societal and Ethical Implications of Computing
9/15/2020","Technology, a concept that may have started with a simple creation, has become powerful enough that people can have instant access to information at the press of a button. The reach of this new age of digital technology has spread internationally, making life easier even in less fortunate countries. However, even computing can have its own sets of ethical challenges. There are many different problems, one of which being outsourcing. There are many different views on this topic, but some neglect certain aspects, such as differences between nations. What may be an opportunity that can be passed up for one person may not be the same for the other person. Because of this aspect, my vision for the importance of ethics is to always compare and consider how much one person can gain at the expense of another, and vice versa.
The situation at hand is an outsourcing issue. It’s very well known that companies can and have hired workers from other countries, most notably India, to work for less than what the company would have to pay an American worker. Depending on which ethical system we look at this problem from, the view can either be ethically correct or incorrect. The first system we will use is the Utilitarianism ethical system. Utilitarianism is the belief that “...the purpose of morality is to make life better by increasing the amount of good things (such as pleasure and happiness) in the world and decreasing the amount of bad things (such as pain and unhappiness.)”  [1]. Utilitarianism usually rejects other moral codes such as customs, traditions, or even religions. Instead, they focus solely on gains and losses. Applying Utilitarianism to this situation, there are some factors to consider. Would giving jobs to Indian programmers provide more good in the world than hiring an American programmer? The important aspect of this is that the US dollar currency is worth more in India. A single dollar equals 73.50 rupees in India. This means that although the company would still be paying Indian programmers less, the differences in currencies means that the money would still be more worthwhile for Indian programmers than it would American programmers. Although the working conditions in India may be worse, they would still get more overall benefit from the job than Americans would, hence raising the overall amount of good in the world. In addition, the company hiring them would still get the same quality of work while also being able to cut costs. The only possible losses are the Americans missing a job opportunity, but the loss is heavily outweighed by the gains for both the company and the Indian workers. Because of this, this would be ethically correct according to Utilitarianism.
The second system we can look at the situation with is the deontological system. While utilitarianism focuses on the ends and neglects the means, deontological focuses on the means and neglects the result. This means that while the results discussed previously outweigh the losses, there is yet another factor to look at; Indian programmers are being taken advantage of as a means to an end. Ideally, a company’s goal is always to achieve the best quality of work while spending the least amount of money. Sara Baase and Timothy Henry describe how this situation is with the deontological system. They state “The programmers are a means to an end: producing a marketable product at a reasonable price. Kant does not say that we must not treat people as a means to an end, but rather that we should not treat them merely as such. And, indeed, the hiring decision does not obviously treat the potential programmers of the two countries differently in a way that has to do with ends and means.” [2] Kant refers to the creator of this principle of ethics, Immanuel Kant. If we think of the Indian workers as a way for the company to cut costs while still achieving their goal, then this would be ethically incorrect. Another factor of Deontological ethics to test are maxims. A maxim is a rule or principle in which one must act [3]. Maxims are a way to test if something is morally correct in terms of the deontological system. The important aspects of maxims are that they must be able to apply to everyone without exceptions, and that they follow a categorical imperative, an absolute and unconditional requirement that must be obeyed in all circumstances and is justified as an end in itself. The maxim for this scenario would be that “I shall hire workers from other countries if it is cheaper to do so.” However, if everyone was to use this rule, then this could lead to American workers struggling to find jobs as giving them a job would take up a lot more resources, while the job market in India would rise but also lead to even more people being used as a means to an end. Since it fails this maxim, hiring Indian workers would still be morally incorrect.
John Rawls’s idea is based around the concept of fairness. He believes that true justice can only be obtained if the system being used treats everyone fairly, regardless of religion, social status, financial status, etc. His reasoning for this is due to acknowledging that people are going to have different backgrounds and as such, need a system that everyone must abide by, that also gives no advantage to a certain group of people. His idea achieves this by having the system treat everyone equally. In addition to his emphasis on fairness, Rawls also has a way to determine if an action is ethically right or wrong on this crucial criteria: if it leaves the least advantaged people worse off than they were before [4]. This fits into his idea of ethics as in order to treat people fairly, people who were already at a disadvantage should not be put into a further disadvantage while giving another an advantage. Using Rawls’s idea on this scenario, we could say that outsourcing would be ethically correct. We can assume that Americans would have more of an advantage as they would be offered more money and possibly benefits than if Indian workers were hired. Indian workers are already at a disadvantage as they would be paid less and have less favorable working conditions. Thus, hiring Indian workers would actually be ethically correct under Rawls's idea as well.
Comparing the different results to each other, two of them consider outsourcing to be ethically correct, while one deems it ethically incorrect. My initial guesses were close to the answers after the analysis, but with Rawls being incorrect. With Rawls, I believed that American workers would be disadvantaged considering that just hiring them would cause the company to spend more money, making them the less favorable candidates for the job. Upon further thought and completing the readings a second time, I realized that Indian workers would be disadvantaged since they would also be expendable due to how exploitable they can be. Hiring managers or leaders in a company can use these results to make their decisions when deciding who to hire for projects.
Outsourcing has always been a contentious topic amongst tech companies. There are multiple benefits and drawbacks if a company decided to outsource for a project. While three of the ethics systems would agree with outsourcing, one of them would not. I believe that outsourcing is a necessary tool. Without a doubt, there is a lot of talent to be used in India. While they may be getting paid less than their American counterparts, the value is much higher to them and their country. Thus, I believe that outsourcing is necessary and ethically correct, if done in moderation.","Bibliography

This article will analyze the problems of software outsourcing and employment of foreign labor in the computer industry from the perspective of general ethics. The criteria involved include utilitarianism, Rawls's theory of justice, social contract theory, Kant's principle, and fair competition. This article contains views on the importance of the ethical code for the computer industry and some personal views on computer ethics.
An important fact in the computer industry: not only in the United States and Western Europe, there are excellent computer programmers, there are also excellent programmers in middle-economy developing countries such as India and China. Due to economic factors such as programmer wage prices, offshore outsourcing in the software industry has become very common.
First of all, the computer industry itself is a service-oriented industry with obvious commercial nature, and the supporting role of the computer industry on various other industries is very obvious. As one of the most profitable industries in the world, the computer industry attracts many new programmers to join. Excluding economic considerations, ethics is very important for the computer industry. The computer is an excellent emerging tool, which is integrated into our daily lives. The use of computers continues to affect the original rights of the people, and has an impact on the long-established ethical and moral concepts of mankind. For the computer industry and the online world, public ethics should also be followed. Based on this idea, the subject of computer ethics was born. Established in 2018 according to the professional ethics committee of the International Computer Association Guidelines, the most important one is: ""Contribute to the happiness of society and mankind, and recognize that everyone is a stakeholder in computing."" [1]. Only by following the ethical code reasonably can human beings use the computer as a tool reasonably and better to make a better contribution to human development. At the same time, following morals and ethics can also improve economic efficiency, reduce and avoid the occurrence of infringements. This is very important for maintaining the long-term development of the computer industry.
The issue of software offshore outsourcing is a complex issue. Now we try to analyze it from the perspective of ethics. We assume that an American software design company needs a team of programmers to build the program after completing the basic software design plan. Now the company has two options: one, you can choose American programmers to complete the program in the United States; Second, you can choose Indian programmers overseas. Assume that the work level of the two teams is the same, but the price of the Indian team is lower. According to the principle of utilitarianism, after considering economic factors, the program company chose the Indian team. Because this improves the profitability of software companies. However, such behavior will reduce the jobs of domestic programmers in the United States, and the direct impact may cause the unemployment of some American programmers. Does this choice violate ethical standards for both Indian and American programmers? Does this choice violate the principle of fairness?
In 1971 Rawls proposed Justice Theory based on the basic ideas of social contract theory. The purpose of this theory is to solve the problem of distribution justice from the perspective of ethics [2]. In Rawls's Theory of Justice, there are two basic principles: the principle of freedom and the principle of equality. Regarding the principle of equality, Rawls believes that absolute fairness should not be followed for distribution issues, and social and economic inequalities should be adjusted so that ""they are to be of the greatest benefit to the least-advantaged members of society, consistent with the just savings principle (the difference principle).""[3]. Here we need to think about, on the one hand, for Indian programmers, due to their lower economic level and poor working environment, such as the lack of job protection mechanisms in India, possible long working hours, etc., whether Indian programmers are programs Vulnerable groups in the member groups. According to the principle put forward by Rawls, whether Indian programmers should be the group that needs to benefit more. On the other hand, for American programmers, because of the potential improper competition that Indian programmers may have, American programmers are at risk of unemployment, so can American programmers also be regarded as a vulnerable group that needs more benefits?
At this time, it is necessary to use another principle of equality proposed by Rawls: ""offices and positions must be open to everyone under conditions of fair equality of opportunity"" [4]. According to this principle, we can think that American programmers and Indian programmers should be in a fair competition under the principle of equal opportunity, and software companies have the responsibility and obligation to ensure the fairness of this job opportunity.
I think there is an important question to think about here: what causes the difference between Indian programmers and American programmers? I think it is because of the difference in nationality and ethnicity, that is, ethical family origin. Based on the principle of equality, Rawls argues that the choices available to each person should not be determined by any ethical factors (such as family background) and innate aptitude (such as athletic talent) [5]. Then, we need to think about whether moral ethics should remove the concept of national boundaries and discard the restrictions of different ethnic groups and different governments. Regarding this question, I think that the ethical code should be applicable to anyone in the world, and there should be no national ideological restrictions (even if the responsibility and loyalty to the country and the nation is a form of moral code).
Based on this view, the U.S. government’s legislation on trade protection and restrictions on the employment of foreign workers would violate ethical standards. Indian programmers and American programmers are in the form of fair competition in this job competition. We can regard this incident as a commercial bid. The Indian team gave a better and lower competitive offer, so the Indian team has Greater hope of victory. The failure of the American team will be understandable. Neither party violates any code of ethics.
In this hypothesis, American software companies play a key role. Software companies have equal and free choice. As an economic company, the software company chose Indian programmers with lower wages. This choice should be considered just. Because, apart from the price advantage, Indian programmers are often considered to be inferior to American programmers in other respects (even if the work level of the two is the same). But it should be noted that we need to think about the potential reasons why Indian programmers can accept lower wages. In actual situations, do Indian programmers work in unsafe and bad working conditions? At the same time, they have sacrificed their own health conditions, such as long hours of work, in exchange for a larger price advantage and promoted their positions Competitiveness.
Do these actions constitute unfair competition? When the software company makes a choice, is it aware of the circumstances that can be anticipated? If a software company is aware of Indian programmers' damage to their own health and potential work hazards, does the program company’s choice of Indian programmers violate the code of ethics? According to Kant's principles, software companies use the price advantage of Indian programmers as a means of profit. This behavior has the potential to harm the health of Indian programmers. Then the software company has violated the moral obligation to protect Indian programmers.
It is very complicated to think about the problems of the computer industry in terms of ethical requirements. Regarding the issue of software offshore outsourcing, Indian programmers, American programmers and American software companies should all be treated as equals and follow the basic principles of freedom and fairness. In the actual process, as long as the selected object and the behavior of the selected object can be explained by any reasonable moral and ethical, and the whole process is determined after sufficient consideration, then I think such behavior can be morally ethical Accepted and understood by the code. Any decision made after thinking about human nature and morality should be recognized.","References

9/12/2020","If you had a chance to hire an American programmer or an Indian programmer for an American company. Who would you hire from normative ethics (ignoring their salary difference and they both skilled at their work)? What is normative ethics? According to Wikipedia, ""Normative ethics is the study of ethical behavior, and is the branch of philosophical ethics that investigates the questions that arise about how one ought to act, in a moral sense"". Some people think it should be an American programmer who should get the job. While some people think it should be an Indian programmer. The correct approach is we can not pick one side every single time. We should always priorities an American programmer over an Indian programmer, but only in one case where we could consider hiring an Indian programmer. I am supporting my thesis by Golden rule, John Rawls ""A Theory of Justice"" and utilitarianism.
Why we should have hired an American programmer most of the time is because there is a law protecting American workers and using the Golden rule to justify your claim. Frist the law that passed in 2017 under the Trump administration that protects American workers. According to The United State Department of Justice, “In 2017, the Civil Rights Division’s Immigrant and Employee Rights Section (IER) launched the Protecting U.S. Workers Initiative, which targets, investigates, and brings enforcement actions against companies that discriminate against U.S. workers in favor of temporary visa workers.  Over the last two years, IER has secured hundreds of thousands of dollars in back pay and other relief for U.S. citizens and non-U.S. citizens with work authorization”;” Under the law, employers generally cannot restrict hiring to only U.S. citizens unless they are required to do so by law, regulation, executive order, or government contract.  This law also prohibits employers from preferring to hire temporary visa holders over qualified and available U.S. workers”. The American government made it very clear that they do not want foreign workers in their country. This also tells us about the majority of American people are getting hurt because companies are hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. We should hire an American programmer for an American company, not an Indian programmer. The reason is it should benefit an American citizens or American permanent residents who have the authorization to work. The American government and its people have the right to protect their jobs from foreign workers. We can support the American government and its people by the Golden rule. What is the Golden rule? According to class slides from Class 2. General Concept of Ethics, “The Bible and Confucius tell us to treat others as we would want them to treat us”. The meaning in the quote is to what you give to others is what you get from others. If I was a citizen of a country where I worked hard, paid taxes, and went to college in that country. Somehow, I did not end up with a job because they decided to hire someone who is outside of my country.  If I was the person who is responsible to hire, I would hire the American programmer because that how I wanted to treated that way and to prioritize American workers.
John Rawls A Theory of Justice helps us understand what ethical choices we need to make in our situation. John theory can support both programmers, but we will see why American programmer is better ethical choices. John Rawls Theory of Justice means fairness in society. As it was stayed by then and now “The principles are in lexical order; that is, that the first should always be prioritised over the second. They are: First, each person has an equal right to a fully adequate scheme of equal basic liberties which is compatible with a similar scheme of liberties for all. Second, social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are both (a) to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged and (b) attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity. The two principles might generally be summed up like this: ‘All social values—liberty and opportunity, income and wealth, and the bases of self-respect—are to be distributed equally unless an unequal distribution of any, or all, of these values is to everyone’s advantage’”. This is telling us if there two sides we should pick a side where it has the least advantaged to make its fairness. In our case, it is an American programmer who is the least advantaged. We can see that in my previous paragraph that law protecting American workers (positive). Another example from A Gift of Fire: Social, Legal, and Ethical Issues for Computing Technology, “In Rawls’ view, an action or a social or political structure is not ethical if it has the effect of leaving the least-advantaged people worse than they were before (or would be in some alternative system). Thus, in a sense, Rawls gives far more weight (indeed, infinite weight) to the utility of the least-advantaged people than to anyone else, and this rule’s fairness may not seem obvious. Two more challenging issues are the decisions of how many least-advantaged people must not be made worse off (the single leastadvantaged individual, or the lowest 1%, or the lowest 49%) and how to deal with policies that might make someone worse off in the short term but better off in the long term. Rawls’ emphasis on concern for the least well off, however, is a reminder to consider impacts on such people; a loss or harm to them can be more devastating than to someone in a better position”. This quote using an ethical way to help and/or support the least advantaged people who are American programmers. American programmers are disadvantages because they are less like to be picked and they need to pay more for American programmers. Most of the time, we should always hire an American programmer.
When is it the right diction to hire an Indian programmer over an American programmer using utilitarianism to support my thesis? Utilitarianism says that we should look for the greatest number who would be happy. From Standford “Classic utilitarians held hedonistic act consequentialism. Act consequentialism is the claim that an act is morally right if and only if that act maximizes the good, that is, if and only if the total amount of good for all minus the total amount of bad for all is greater than this net amount for any incompatible act available to the agent on that occasion. (Cf. Moore 1912, chs. 1–2.)” . In other words, find where most people are happiest. A thought experiment: Sam and Tom applied for a job, but Sam is granted to get a job. Tom can get the job if the sam drops the job. Tom also two kids and a wife if they do not get the job his family would not survive by the next month. On the other hand, Sam is a very young man who just got of college he can stay with his family members(with or without a job), but Sam will have a hard time finding his next job if he drops this one. Utilitarianism would say that Sam should drop his job, so Tom can have the job. We can also apply to our situation but under a few circumstances. Which are one Indian country is doing terrible than the US, natural disasters that just left the place in terrible conditions, etc. We only hire an Indian programmer when the US is in perfect condonation where US citizens can easily find similar jobs. Then we can hire an Indian programmer using utilitarianism where he/she can bring the most happiness to is a county or he/her family.
In conclusion, The ethical choice is to pick an American programmer, but in one case we have to pick an Indian programmer. The new concept I learned is John Rawls  Theory of Justice"". Where I never consider and look at where in society has losing side and/or unfairness. Who would you pick?","Reference

tb693248,,"Since humans first walked the earth, advances have been being made where technology is concerned.  Innovations are still coming to be in 2020 and these modern inventions are perhaps more powerful than any that society has ever seen.  “And with great power comes great responsibility.  Don’t ever forget that.”  said Uncle Ben to Peter Parker in the 2002 Hollywood classic, “Spiderman. [1]    ” Despite this quote being spoken by and delivered to fictional entities, the message in that quote is one that applies directly to reality.  As the power of technology is growing, the responsibility that comes with utilizing it grows proportionately.  For example, in what is perhaps the worst situation possible for humanity, a global war where the warring factions decide to use the full extent of their state-of-the-art weaponry… society would be brought to complete and utter ruin within minutes by intercontinental ballistic missiles and airborne poisons that required nothing more to be unleashed than the pressing of a few buttons by a few individuals who received an order to press them.  On scales smaller than global thermonuclear war, the ethical responsibilities of those in the technology industry are still of high importance where matters like data privacy, surveillance, criminal investigation, sales, and staffing are concerned.  On the subject of staffing, particularly whether or not to outsource work to those in other countries when domestic employees are available, the country in which a potential employee lives is irrelevant to making an ethically sound decision.
Many ethical paradigms have come to exist in the world.  One of these paradigms is referred to as utilitarianism.  A utilitarian approach to an ethical issue has one simple objective in mind maximizing utility for the “greater good” of society.  As such, a purely utilitarian decision is made by selecting the option that provides the most “net-goodness” to society, regardless of moral implications.  There exists another ethical paradigm known as deontalism with a decision-making process that is remarkably different than the one employed by utilitarianism.  The deontalistic approach involves making decisions based on the maxim, “How would everyone else handle this?”  This approach focuses much more on morality than a purely utilitarian approach, while focusing much less on net-goodness.
As technology is very much a global concept, complicated ethical dilemmas can arise.  Today, a common example of such a dilemma is one experienced by employers: who should be hired?  With modern communications technology, people are able to work remotely and transmit data faster than ever before.  Due to a lack of geographical restrictions brought on by this communicatory technology, employers can seek employees in different countries with ease.  Consider a staffing director at an American software engineering firm faced with a decision of whether to hire an American programmer or an Indian programmer.
Applying a utilitarian approach to this decision is complicated here, as one must define the party for whom one is looking to maximize utility.    If the utilitarian scope in this case is aimed at benefitting global society, it would seem that the decision to hire one programmer versus another is arbitrary, as both programmers are people that will be paid for their work.  However, if one is looking to serve the greater good of their own nation, the decision to hire a domestic programmer is likely the decision of greater utility.  To approach the same dilemma from a deontalistic standpoint requires a similar consideration to be made about which group one looks to find their decision-driving maxim.  If one consults global society, it is likely that again, this decision becomes relatively arbitrary.  However, if one were to derive their maxim from a more locally-restricted (e.g., United States) population, it may drive the decision toward hiring an American programmer in an effort to keep wealth within the United States.
A modern philosopher named, John Rawls believed that neither a utilitarian nor deontalistic approach should be applied to ethical matters.  “Rawls has no universal principle: “The correct regulative principle for anything,” he says, “depends on the nature of that thing.””[2]. In Rawls’ belief that situations where regulative principles are to be questioned individually versus following a utility calculation or grand maxim, Rawls assures that the decision logic is specific to problem at hand.   Rawls introduced another concept, “the Veil of Ignorance.”  “Rawls says, “Among the essential features of this situation is that no one knows his place in society, his class position or social status, nor does any one know his fortune in the distribution of natural assets and abilities, his intelligence, strength and the like. I shall even assume that the parties do not know their conceptions of the good or their special psychological propensities. The principles of justice are chosen behind a veil of ignorance” (TJ, 12/11). This veil of ignorance deprives the parties of all knowledge of particular facts about themselves, about one another, and even about their society and its history. [3]  ”
“Rawls sought to establish principles for proper political power in a society with people of varying religions, viewpoints, lifestyles, and so on. [4]” This veil of ignorance described by Rawls can prove to be valuable in the hiring dilemma described earlier.  Provided that one dons the veil, it now becomes a question of whether to hire one programmer or another—the nationality of the programmer will be ignored entirely.   On these grounds, the decision to hire either programmer must be based not on where the programmer is from, but rather what the programmer could accomplish for the company.
The idea that this analysis neglects both financial aspects and technical details of this problem implies that the decision reached here is purely one of ethics.  After applying Rawls’ veil of ignorance to one’s perspective (effectively removing the American and Indian attributes from the job candidates), the choice is completely arbitrary when neglecting the technicalities and finances of the decision— hire a programmer or a programmer?  Either decision leaves one party employed and the other potentially jobless, but both programmers are completely equal under these constraints.  For this reason, the decision is arbitrary on ethical grounds.
Different ethical paradigms operate with different measures of effectiveness, but in the cases of deontalism and utilitarianism, exceptional cases may cause an unethical decision to be made when following their respective schema.  Personally, I support the notion that for the sake of making ethical decisions, one should wear a veil of ignorance in an effort to ensure that decisions being made are both fair and considerate.  In the case of these two programmers, I do not believe that their geographic location / race should even be considered on ethical grounds. In practice, do acknowledge however that this decision is not one to be made solely on such ethical grounds.","References

tp473888,,"In computer science people are often faced with ethical questions about the work they are doing. They have to decide the right course of action given the parameters they are working under their own systems of ethics. This is important because computer scientists are responsible for responsible computing. They have to make the right decisions to protect society as a whole if they can. In this particular case the issue is whether a company wants to hire Indian or U.S. programmers. We have to decide whether outsourcing jobs is an ethical thing to do versus keeping them local. There are a few different systems of ethics we can use to examine this problem, but in this case, we will examine this problem from the perspective of utilitarianism and through that of deontological ethics to determine what is the more ethical solution. Based on the results of that, it is more ethical to hire Indian programmers than U.S. programmers.
Firstly, we shall use utilitarianism to try and tackle the issue. Utilitarianism is defined as “the view that the morally right action is the action that produces the most good.” [1] Utilitarianism can be difficult to find a solution with because there are so many different factors and one might not know all of the consequences of their actions until they do them. It does not make a big difference between hiring Indian or U.S. programmers if we do not look beyond the number of programmers, but if we look at the impacts of each it gets more messy. From here it depends on how we weigh the utility of different things, “Shall we weigh the utilities of the programmers according to the number of dollars they will receive? That favors hiring the U.S. programmers. Or should we weigh utility by comparing the pay to the average salary in each country or by comparing the number of other job opportunities available? Those measures might favor hiring the Indians.” [2, Pg. 1] This shows how just utilitarianism can be hard to work with due to all of the factors and consequences that come from it compared to other systems of ethics. John Rawls’s Principles of Justice as Fairness are supposed to provide “a superior understanding of justice to that of (…) utilitarianism.” [3, Sec. 4]
John Rawls was a 20th century philosopher who had many thoughts on the matter of ethics and how we should judge. In particular his “Principles of Justice as Fairness” [4, Sec. 2-d] can be applied to this situation to determine who it is more ethical to hire. His first principle is that “each person has the same indefeasible claim to a fully adequate scheme of equal basic liberties, which scheme is compatible with the same scheme of liberties for all.” [3, Sec. 4.3] This is just saying that everyone has the same basic rights as each other. The one that is more relevant is the second principle, “Social and economic inequalities are to satisfy two conditions: a. They are to be attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity; b. They are to be to the greatest benefit of the least-advantaged members of society (…).” [3, Sec. 4.3] In other words, everyone should have an equal opportunity to the opportunity, but it should help the people who need it more. This will be used to help decide what is the most ethical course of action to take in regard to the programmers.
Deontological ethics can be used to paint a clearer picture in this case. We will be using Immanuel Kant’s branch of deontological ethics here. That means we will be using a maxim, essentially a rule that one should always follow to decide if something is ethical or not. [5, Sec. 2.4] In other words, maxims are essentially a moral law that should always be follow. Different people might have different maxims based on who they are and what they believe in. Several different maxims could be used to lead to different outcomes. If one used a maxim such as, “people should always hire domestically.”, then it would obviously favor U.S. programmers. If maxims like, “we should always give the consumer the cheapest price.” or “we should support those who are less privileged”, were used, then it would favor Indian programmers. This is where Rawls’s Justice as Fairness comes into play. Since both have the opportunity to be hired, the ones who are the least-advantaged should be chosen based on Rawls’s second principle of Justice as Fairness. Therefore, we will turn Rawls’s second principle into the maxim that those who are the least-advantage should receive the most benefit. If one were to take the average Indian and U.S. programmer, it seems like the U.S. programmer would have more advantages and generally be more privileged. That would mean the Indian programmer should be hired as they are generally less privileged and are the least-advantaged in this situation. Using deontological ethics Indian programmers should be hired based on the maxim that the least-advantaged person should benefit the most.
My initial feeling was that one should hire U.S. programmers, however that was not backed up by any evidence and was just a gut feeling. Before any analysis, I thought that the utilitarian approach would likely mean hiring the Indian programmers. However, after analyzing it, it was a lot more complicated and I could not come to a solid conclusion in either direction due to the ripple effect of the results. In regard to deontological ethics, prior to researching the issue I knew that it really all depended on what maxim was used, it could be made to fit hiring either group. After reading about John Rawls, I immediately knew what maxim to use based on his work as he seemed to believe in equity instead equality when making such decisions. Rawls’s work was a good basis from which to make a decision regarding what maxim to use. Depending on what someone was trying to do, the justification could be completely different. Because every person’s opinion on what is harmful or morally right and wrong are different, it can be hard to find one system that fits everyone’s beliefs or fits every situation. For me I believe that Rawls system worked well for me in this case, but I do not know how I would react if that situation was affecting me personally.
These results can be used by companies who want to hire ethically based on equity. However, at the same time I believe that companies would not just hire Indian programmers to make up for them being disadvantaged compared to the average American programmer. I think they would mainly be hired due to potentially working for less money and that this could be unfortunately used as good public relations by using these results as an excuse. Someone could pretty easily find some way to say that their position on the outsourcing of jobs is an ethically correct one, and just as easily make one up to make themselves look better regardless of their actual reasoning. In the end, it really depends on what people are trying to accomplish by hiring the programmers, or in any situation regarding ethics.","Bibliography

Societal and Ethical Implications of Computing September 13, 2020
Abstract","Through “Ethics of Hiring Foreign Workers”, John Rawls’ theory provided a general description of ethics and theories such as Deontology, Utilitarianism and different types of rights. In my personal views, the new concept that I would apply to the situation of whether or not to hire foreign workers is to hire majorly U.S. programmers and to only have a maximum of a small percentage such as 10% among the total of programmers in every company. The purpose that this serves is to help the computing industry grow in their expertise rather than the company’s economical gain. I want to apply a new theory that reaches an equilibrium among the different theories to be as ethical as possible where it considers the impacts on least advantaged individuals more heavily but also does not neglect any theory that doesn’t offer solutions for them.","Introduction
There are extensive situations that challenge political order in social contract theories. A specific situation that displays this is in the “Ethics of Hiring Foreign Workers” section in the book “A Gift of Fire: Social, Legal, and Ethical Issues for Computing Technology” by Sara Baase and Timothy Henry. They discussed the ethicality of whether to allow the hiring of Indian programmers or to only allow the hiring of U.S. programmers. From a personal point of view, majority of programmers that are being hired should be from the U.S.. Computing in itself is already an extremely competitive field, and as someone who’s currently in the computer science field, I wouldn’t want to compete with U.S. programmers as well as another country’s programmers. The main benefits gained from hiring Indian programmers are only economically and evident in the business standpoint, so the views I’ll be portraying is from the employees’ side. My ethics follow Rawls’ theory, and combination of theories: Deontology, Claim rights and a slight Utilitarian view. The new concept I’d apply to the situation is to reach an equilibrium among all the different perspectives, but where the impact on individuals such as the least advantaged people are of more concern than maximizing utility.
Body 1
Immanuel Kant introduced the theory of Deontology which emphasized on duty and absolute rules and their consequences. Kant’s deontological view states that “the only intrinsically good thing is good will”, and so in this case “the most important factor is the actor’s intention rather than the consequences of the action”. From the deontological perspective, Indian programmers should not be hired because the intention of hiring foreign workers doesn’t benefit the working class of America, but only the business owners profit from since Indian
programmers are cheaper. Deontology also follows the principle of never treating people as merely means to ends, but rather as ends in themselves. Given the principle, it is unethical to hire Indian programmers as that means they are not appreciating the inherent value of U.S.
programmers and instead are using programmers as merely means to an end. Similarly to this concept, another political philosopher: Rawls’ theory of political justice weighs heavily on the utility of the least advantaged than anyone such as employees. Hence, the rational decision is to place priority in providing jobs for U.S. programmers since people of the country should be given jobs before people from other countries get the opportunity. The relationship between Rawls’ theory about the least advantaged people are depicted as programmers who are being used as a means to an end in the deontological view. People who own companies without a doubt hold the most power and with high power comes with more control over other people’s lives. In order to ensure that people will deter from abusing power and keeping their decision ethical, more assistance and flexibility should be given to the least advantaged which are the employees.
Body 2
Furthermore, Rawls’ theory corresponds to the conceptual formulation known as the ‘veil of ignorance’. This is a “tool for considering ethical and social issues”, where “each person behind the veil of ignorance does not know his or her gender, age, race, talents, wealth, and so on”. These policies chosen would be fair for everyone, while protecting the most vulnerable and least advantaged members of society. This supports claim rights as these rights are decided by society where people decide what the basic interests of everyone should be and claim rights were one of them. Claim rights imposes an obligation on people like the government to provide certain things such as one’s occupation. Given this right, it would not be ethical to offer jobs to Indian programmers before supplying jobs for all U.S. programmers. This continues to be true even though “it is equally logical... to argue that paying the higher rate for U.S. programmers is wasteful, or charity, or simply overpayment” as they could hire more programmers but from India with the same amount of money they’re putting out. It is unfortunate from a business standpoint, but it is the most ethical decision if it's for supporting America’s claim rights.
Body 3
John Stuart Mill introduced Utilitarianism where its philosophy stands for the moral act that produces the greatest happiness or utility for the greatest number of people. This theory best fits under the business ethical framework as it supports the hiring of Indian since it increases the utility of companies and such that “customers benefit from the lower price of the product, and the owners of the company benefit from the profits”. Utilitarianism is the least ethical theory to apply to situations because it doesn’t consider the impact and effects on the more vulnerable
individuals. For example, if companies were to have worse working conditions for Indian programmers as well as paying them, then it would be unjust, but because majority of people would be happy such as the customers benefiting from the lower prices and companies profiting, then it wouldn’t matter and the programmers would just have to tolerate the conditions. Moreover, the negative consequences for American workers would rise if more Indian programmers were hired as that would mean less job opportunities would be available to them.  Thus, veil of ignorance is fairer than Utilitarianism as though both concepts are congruent  to wanting the best system of justice that “will bring the greatest total amount of happiness to the society as a whole”, veil of ignorance also uses “the veil to mask personal interests, thereby getting rid of any biased or criminal interests”.
Results The idea that I’d offer is to create an equilibrium among the theories where it is more considerate towards vulnerable individuals, but it would also not completely remove the option of hiring foriegn workers. Such as Rawls’ concept, it would take into consideration the least advantaged people, the U.S. programmers. In this case through Deontology, the most intrinsically good decision is to only allow a small percentage of Indian programmers to be hired in every company such as 10% of the total programmers. This is so that the U.S programmers’ jobs won’t be taken away and the competitiveness will mostly be against other U.S.
programmers. The reason behind this has no interest in increasing their profits, but to drive them to only hiring the most knowledgeable and experienced indian programmers, so it will help America advance in the computation field. Thus, supporting Claim rights as now the obligation to provide jobs for Americans is better enforced, which also maximizes utility in the most ethical way possible as members of society will be employed easier.
I had some prior knowledge about ethics from previous social science and philosophy classes and knew what Utilitarianism was and knew a lot of the general concepts such as Deontology, veil of ignorance but just not the formal names for it. Due to the fact that I was never put in a position that forced me to ponder this, a significant concept that stood out to me was that I never thought about the lengths that companies would go to save money; such as putting people in worse working conditions than others and to hire foreign workers despite the quality of work for less money. In this case, my vision of the importance of ethics for the industry of computing has definitely been molded stronger. In general, people who are going into the industry of computing whether they want to work for a company or run a company can use this information by applying it into their life and being more selfless when making a decision that affects others in the computing industry.
Conclusion
In conclusion, if given the opportunity, I would apply an equilibrium based theory where the political justice system is balanced in all aspects where the concern of individuals weighs
heavier following Rawls' theory. Therefore, the majority of the programmers hired would be U.S. programmers and a very small percentage would be Indian programmers. In the ethical outlook Deontology is more ethical than Utilitarianism but Utilitarianism is far more beneficial and thrives in the business aspect. Through the analysis and readings, my personal ethics on the industry of computing have become more concrete and my view have been further broadened.

Analysis of Internet companies' principles of hiring Indian programmers","With the development of the Internet, the online office has become the first choice of many people, especially for industries that cannot do without computers, such as software engineering. One of the advantages of online office is that it is not restricted by region or distance, which means that people can not only find jobs in their cities, but also can work across cities, states, and countries. In this context, as a manager of an American software company, we need to consider whether to hire local engineers or Indian engineers. From the perspective of economic benefits, we will choose Indian engineers because India's average wage is lower than that in the United States. However, from the standpoint of ethics, we may have different choices. This essay mainly discusses whether to hire American or Indian engineers from the perspective of ethics.
From a utilitarianism point of view, we can weigh the utility according to programmers' wages. According to Sen, “Utilitarianism advocates the pursuit of maximum happiness, but everyone's happiness indicators are different”. The economic development of the United States and India determines the difference in the average wages of two countries, even the wage level in the United States is far greater In India. This has nothing to do with the engineers' skills and knowledge but is determined by the external environment. It also reflects in all aspects of the lives of the people of the two countries. For example, the prices of goods in the United States are higher than those in India. But this does not mean that the lower wages of Indian engineers cannot make them happy, because their salaries may not be low, even higher than other industries in India. So, from this point, it states that hiring foreign workers accord with utilitarianism, which is the one of the reasons that company should hire Indian engineers.
For software companies, the company's primary purpose is to make money, which can achieve in two ways. “One is to increase revenue, and the other is to reduce company costs; this is why many companies are now recruiting many people overseas” (Wessel, D., & Greenberg, S. , 2011). Indian engineers are undoubtedly a better choice because compared to American engineers, companies only need to pay Indian engineers a lower salary to complete the same work, which is the company's happiness. Some people argue that this is unfair. Why should we treat American and Indian engineers differently just because of their nationality? Or because of their different technical levels. In modern society where fairness and equality are emphasized, some people strongly oppose that. I think the United States and India's external environment is why they encounter this issue. Prices in the United States are higher, including the cost of education, such as students' tuition, the number of teachers that schools can provide, etc. Even their daily expenses are quite different. From my point of view, these are all external force majeure, which we cannot, at least, not change in the short term. So I do not think nationality and technology are the reasons why Indian engineers are treated unfairly in the US and India. Then, from the perspective of the company's interests, Indian engineers should be hired to achieve the company's maximum happiness.
Besides, some people think that Indian programmers' behavior with the lower payment is unethical and unfair to American programmers, because Indian programmers may find jobs more easily. Others believe that it is unreasonable to pay higher for American programmers because they are almost doing the same job. I think they are getting jobs at lower pay is not unfair to Indian programmers because it is not what they can decide. According to Lee, R., & Wilbur, E. R, the social development in India determines that India is a relatively backward third-world country comparing to the USA. The gap in economy and education has also led to the difference in engineers' wages. Regardless of whether the two countries' engineers are technically advanced or not, Indian engineers also hope that they can have a higher salary. However, if they made a request, they are likely to be rejected by the company because they will lose their advantage of ""low compensation"".  According to Rawls, “reasonable people, recognizing that a legal (or political) structure is necessary for social order, will want to cooperate on terms that all accept”, I think the difference in wages is a proof that everyone accepts this social order. If both Indian and American engineers can complete same work and accept it, from the perspective of the company's interests, hiring Indian engineers is a smart choice.
Moreover, in my opinion, the company should treat everyone fairly according to their ability,not nationality. According to Lee, Y. J., & Sabharwal, M. (2016), it is undeniable that compared with Indian schools, American schools have better teaching staff, and students can get a better education. Of course, it is also accompanied by higher costs. This is also one of the reasons for differential treatment.
Some argue that companies should pay American programmers the same as Indian programmers. On the one hand, they believe that the company should treat everyone fairly according to individual ability, not nationality. On the other hand, the working conditions of Indian engineers are worse than those in the United States. But the structure of India's entire labor market determines the wage gap between the United States and India. One company cannot change the social structure of India. From a ethics point of view, I think that the company should pay a higher salary than Indian law or market conditions. On the one hand, the company is obliged to improve its employees' working conditions to stimulate employees' enthusiasm to some extent. On the other hand, out of human kindness and cooperative natures, this is conducive to self-recognition. It can also help Indians develop. However, it is only at a higher price than Indian laws or market conditions. If you want Indian engineers and American engineers to get the same salary, it is still challenging to achieve.
In conclusion, I think it is entirely feasible for companies to hire Indian engineers at lower prices. First of all, the difference in economic and social development between the United States and India is the main reason for employees' different treatment, which has nothing to do with personal ethics. So, whether it is for the company or the employees, this is determined by market competition. Even Indian employees are victims because they do the same job but get fewer wages. Then, from a utilitarianism point of the company, hiring Indian employees can save the company costs. Of course, the company can pay higher prices than Indian laws or market conditions, which can not only promote local economic development but also stimulate employee enthusiasm. However, this is only a slight improvement to Indian engineers' situation, and it does not enable Indian engineers to receive the same treatment as American engineers.","Reference

September 14, 2020","The importance of ethics for the industry of computing is be something that everyone should at least think about since mostly everyone is involved in some way with the industry of computing even if they don’t recognize it themselves. It is not something only the people who directly work inside the industry should be concern about with things like plagiarism and copyright issues. But everyday people who are use the products produced by the industry on a daily basis should be concern about it as well, both in the sense of protecting their personal data and to avoid being targeted. People should also understand the possible damage from ignoring the importance of ethics for the industry of computing can range anything from scams, hacking to identity theft in term of personal well-being to exploitation of worker and dishonest business practices in the industry.
“Computers are special technology and they raise some special ethical issues…computer ethics is the analysis of the nature and social impact of computer technology and the corresponding formulation and justification of policies for the ethical use of such technology.” [1] As the increase in the capabilities of technology, there is more and more issues surrounding computer ethics that starting to become more obvious. At the same time, there is more research and improvements are being done to trying to fix the issues as well. Majority of the professional in the industry of computing is most interested in normative ethics, where it “studies how philosophical concepts can be implemented in social life–is a base for developing laws and regulations.” [2] Dealing with issues such as cyber-crime, privacy violation and responsibility of professionals working in the field. However, ethics just like justice can be view under many different lenses vary from utilitarianism, Kant’s theory, Rawl's idea and more. Ethics is so different from the laws where people mostly agree and follow with same understanding. Ethics on the flip side, vary by person where everyone seems to have a slightly different standard on what is right and wrong.
In “Ethics of hiring foreign worker” the scenario presented by the authors is where “You are a manager at a software company about to begin a large software project. You will need
to hire dozens of programmers. Using the Internet for communication and software delivery,
you can hire programmers in another country at a lower salary than programmers in your
country. Should you do this?” [3] with the assumption the company is in the United States and the choices between what country the programmers are from are limited to only U.S. and Indian. The authors look at the issue with multiple different concepts of ethics. Starting with Kant’s theory where “the rightness or wrongness of actions does not depend on their consequences but on whether they fulfill our duty”[4] and under the theory the authors view the situation as a pure trade where the company pays the programmer with money for work. Thus, the authors concluded the decision at the end doesn’t create a visible difference in treatment between the two groups of programmers that affect the trade. The authors ended the section by talk about possible effects of the end decision started from the programmer’s side with pay, working condition and other benefits to the not so obvious effect to the groups of people like community where the programmer are in, customers, owners of the company and other business that can be involved in one form or another. As well as some possible ways to prevent exploitation from happening to the programmers in the form of law and ethical requirements.
On the other hand, “John Rawls was an American political philosopher in the liberal tradition. His theory of justice as fairness describes a society of free citizens holding equal basic rights and cooperating within an egalitarian economic system.”[5] The three foundation ideas of Rawls were free, equal and fair. Based on Rawls, the approach for people to think more mortally equal and make decisions more fairly in term of deciding in how the rules of society should be made is the veil of ignorance by imagine us sitting behind a veil that keeps us from knowing anything about ourselves from gender, race, position in society, natural abilities and have no way of finding out anything about our personal circumstances. With the missing information about ourselves, we will have to start more logically consider how every decision made is going to affect how society functions. While thinking with Rawl’s veil of ignorance in mind and looking back at the situation with a U.S company hiring programmers from two different places, it seems like the situation felt a bit different now with the missing information about ourselves with potential of personally getting affected by the decision. Going with Rawl’s approach, I believe most people will agree on given a even chances to the programmers from both country, potentially ignoring the country they are in and giving programmers hired at the end with similar treatment especially when the veil of ignorance is add on top of Rawl’s theory of justice is fairness.
Before starting this class, I had a limited amount of understanding in ethics for the industry of computing. It always has been something I am interested in and read some article from time to time, but never really found the time to do a deep research about it. Like many others who fear the unknown, my center of focus was always on the potential danger to society of computing as technology improves and getting automated compare to the current situation involving ethics. In a way I believe a lot of people is a little desensitized with unethical practice in the computing industry especially with many of the big company that get expose to be selling personal data. This really goes to show nothing is truly free, the only difference is who and when the price will be pay by. At the same time, people should understand the all the possible damage from unethical practice in the industry and understand what action that can take in letting the industry know that people do care about the ethics. With the new knowledge and tools, I believe I will be able to analyze some decision by industry of computing in a deep level and to concern about the people who are affected by the decision both directly and indirectly.","References

Zahra Hashimee
Doctor Vladimir Kuperman
ICSI 300z
September 15, 2020","Leveraging ethical principles when considering whether to hire foreign workers in the computing world, or in the hiring industry in general, can be very useful. This is especially the case in a highly unregulated capitalistic society that is ripe with ethical dilemmas. While legislature exists that preemptively protects against encountering these issues, such as laws prioritizing the hiring of educated domestic workers, critically examining ethical concepts can help lay out an objective framework that relies less on aimless governmental oversight. In this essay, two ethical concepts will be reviewed with goals of discussing whether hiring foreign workers (Indian workers in particular) over U.S. workers in the computing industry, or vice-versa, is justified and why that is the case. Specifically, the use of utilitarianism and Kantian ethics as described in Sara Baase’s A Gift of Fire will be examined in order to think about the ethics and moral obligations surrounding hiring foreign workers.
In the section titled: “Ethics of Hiring Foreign Workers” from Sara Baase’s A Gift of Fire, Baase tactfully illustrates how two prominent ethical views can be useful in disentangling the problematic encounters in the hiring of foreign workers [1]. Utilitarianism, first introduced by Jeremy Bentham in the 19th century, emphasizes the importance of maximizing the greatest good for the greatest number [2]. In the utilitarian view, Baase considers which parties are benefiting the most (greatest good), assuming the number of employees remains the same. In order to understand which parties are receiving the greatest good, however, one must first consider how to define “good”, or in the case of hiring programmers, utility. If, on the one hand, utility is defined as the dollar earned per hour, hiring domestic, U.S. trained employers would be justified. This would be maximizing the greatest good for the greatest number of U.S. trained employers, whereas paying foreign-hired, Indian employees a lower amount would not reach this same, maximal potential. Conversely, however, defining utility in a different light can invalidate the aforementioned logic. If, for example, utility is defined as the relative income earned when compared to the average salary of employees working in the same field in same country or region, foreign workers would reap the greatest good. This is because Indians working in the Indian computing industry earn significantly less than Indians working in the American computing industry. At this point, one might ponder whether using a utilitarian ethical framework to make a hiring decision is useful at all, as it seems to be contradictory. Before this issue is addressed, however, it is important to look at this from the Kantian perspective as described in Baase’s work.
One of Immanuel Kant’s most influential ethical concepts called the “end in itself” describes how people ought to be treated from a moral, rational, and ethical point of view. In this view, Kant concurs that human beings should be treated as an end in themselves and not a means to some other end [3]. In other words, in no circumstance is it ethical to manipulate or use a human being to achieve some other ulterior motive or goal, irrespective of whether the person in consideration is suffering or not. Humans have value in and of themselves and should be treated as such. In the case of hiring foreign employees from India for a programming job, is the primary goal to provide these workers with a source of income they would not otherwise have access to? In this situation, the foreign workers are viewed as an end, that is to say they are hired because their value as employees seeking a fair earning is a prime consideration. They are not used as a means to lower overhead for the company or to maximize the company’s efficiency at the lowest possible cost. However, what if the inverse is true? What if the goal of the company is simply to save on overhead, or worse, to limit hiring opportunities for competing interests in India (e.g. soaking up employees that would otherwise work in competing companies that might pose a threat to the American companies)? In this view, the workers are not being treated as ends but rather as means, a stance that is unethical in Kantian ethics. Thus, it is important to ensure that the company's vision remains in line with the idea that hiring any employee, foreign or otherwise, prioritizes the employee as an end in him/herself as opposed to a means to something else. It seems then that making a hiring decision is simply a matter of perspective and subjective reasoning from the eyes of the employer that employees must automatically submit to. While this might present a point of contention for many, John Rawls’s take on Hobbes’s social contract and his theory of political justice provides a good framework for understanding how reasoning can stem from a rational and moral standpoint.
Society is inherently diverse in thought, beliefs, and interests that can often result in inevitable social disorder when bristles arise. In such a state, it is challenging to assess 1) what rules or laws are impartial and reasonable to all citizens and 2) who exactly is a viable candidate for constructing such rules or laws. In brief, Rawls addresses this dilemma by examining the world from what he calls the “original position” whereby all citizens partaking in a society see the world with an intention of achieving social order [4]. From this perspective, he contends that achieving social order requires citizens to seek impartiality and temporarily dissociate themselves from their interests and beliefs (place themselves behind a “veil of ignorance”). That is to say, for society to ascribe law from the original position, it should place itself before a “veil of ignorance” and construct laws with the goal of prioritizing equitable access to civil liberties for all its citizens. Thus, citizens who have adopted the original position (i.e. any reasonable and moral being) would see that abiding by these rules (if properly constructed) will provide the society with order and would be beneficial to all, irrespective of any one belief system or self-interest [5]. How then does this construct, in conjunction with utilitarianism and Kantian ethics, tie in to building a framework from which to reference when considering whether or not to hire foreign workers?
From the utilitarian perspective, there seems not to be a clear answer as to whether hiring foreign workers is ethically justified, as this is entirely dependent on how utility is defined. Furthermore, the Kantian perspective demonstrates that hiring foreign employees can be justified depending on the intent of the employer and whether that places the employee in a state of being an end rather than a means. Lastly, the employer's intent to hire a foreign versus domestically hired employee can be seen as arbitrarily assigned. In this view, employers can deceitfully hire foreign workers under the guise of Kantian justice, a situation that would be seen as problematic by Rawls’s social construct and theory of political justice. In that vein, the ethical nature of hiring a domestic employee versus a foreign employee stems largely from the perspective of the employer, which when appropriately taking into consideration the three aforementioned ethical views, can be seen as either justified (if it is in line with ethical views) or unjustified (if it is out of line).
This essay provides an extremely valuable framework for thinking about the ethics of hiring a domestic worker versus a foreign worker. Baase’s teachings and portrayal of the utilitarian and Kantian view of hiring foreign workers provides a blueprint from which employers should cross-reference when making hiring decisions, ensuring that they are in line with the ethical views presented. Furthermore, Rawls’s use of the social contract and political justice allows the employer to find reprieve in the fact that his or her decisions are not in fact arbitrary, but rather rely on an impartial and rational perspective that prioritizes equity among all stakeholders involved. Prior to this analysis, I was at a loss regarding how hiring decisions are to be made when comparing domestic to foreign employees. Now, however, I seek solace in the fact that relying on an ethical framework for addressing these dilemmas my future career exists.","Works Cited
